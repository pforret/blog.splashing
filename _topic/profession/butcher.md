# Profession: butcher

A butcher is a person who may slaughter animals, dress their flesh, sell their meat, or participate  within any combination of these three tasks. They may prepare standard cuts of meat and poultry for sale in retail or wholesale food  establishments. A butcher may be employed by supermarkets, grocery stores, butcher shops and fish markets,  slaughter houses, or may be self-employed.Butchery is an ancient trade, whose duties may date back  to the domestication of livestock; its practitioners formed guilds in England as far back as 1272. Since the 20th century, many countries and local jurisdictions offer trade certifications for  butchers in order to ensure quality, safety, and health standards but not all butchers have formal  certification or training. Trade qualification in English-speaking countries is often earned through an apprenticeship  although some training organisations also certify their students.
