# Profession: athlete

An athlete  is a person who competes in one or more sports that involve physical strength, speed or 
endurance.
The use of the term in several sports, such as golf or auto racing, becomes a controversial issue.

Athletes may be professionals or amateurs.
Most professional athletes have particularly well-developed physiques obtained by extensive 
physical training and strict exercise accompanied by a strict dietary regimen.
