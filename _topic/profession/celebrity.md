# Profession: celebrity

Celebrity is a condition of fame and broad public recognition of a person or group as a result of 
the attention given to them by mass media.
An individual may attain a celebrity status from having great wealth, their participation in sports 
or the entertainment industry, their position as a political figure, or even from their connection 
to another celebrity.
'Celebrity' usually implies a favorable public image, as opposed to the neutrals 'famous' or 
'notable', or the negatives 'infamous' and 'notorious'.
