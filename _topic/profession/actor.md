# Profession: actor

An actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a performance.
The actor performs in the flesh in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as 
film, radio, and television.
The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής, literally one who answers.
The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based 
on a real person or fictional character.
 This can also be considered an actor's role, which was called this due to scrolls being used in 
the theaters.
