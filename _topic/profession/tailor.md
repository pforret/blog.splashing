# Profession: tailor

A tailor is a person who makes or alters clothing, particularly in men's clothing.
Although the term dates to the thirteenth century, tailor took on its modern sense in the late 
eighteenth century, and now properly refers to makers of men's and women's suits, coats, trousers, 
and similar garments, commonly of wool, linen, or silk.

Fictional tailors include the tailor in The Tailor of Gloucester, The Emperor's New Clothes  and 
The Valiant Little Tailor.
A more recent example is John le Carr√©'s The Tailor of Panama.
