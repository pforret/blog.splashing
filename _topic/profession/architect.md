# Profession: architect

An architect is a person who plans, designs and oversees the construction of buildings.
To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and 
the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their 
principal purpose.
Etymologically, the term architect derives from the Latin architectus, which derives from the 
Greek, i.e., chief builder.The professional requirements for architects vary from place to place.
An architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus the architect must undergo specialized 
training consisting of advanced education and a practicum  for practical experience to earn a 
license to practice architecture.
Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction, 
though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played a pivotal role in the 
development of the profession as a whole.
