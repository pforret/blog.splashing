# Profession: prime minister

A prime minister or chief of cabinet is the head of the cabinet and the leader of the ministers in  the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system. Under those systems a prime minister is not the head of state, but rather the head of government,  serving as the principal administrator under either a monarch in a monarchy or a president in a  republican form of government.   In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the  presiding and actual head of government and head/owner of the executive power.
