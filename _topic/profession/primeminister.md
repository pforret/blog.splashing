# Profession: prime minister

A prime minister or a premier is the head of the cabinet and the leader of the ministers in the 
executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system.
Under those systems, a prime minister is not the head of state, but rather the head of government, 
serving typically under a monarch in a democratic constitutional monarchy or under a president in a 
republican form of government.

In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the 
presiding and actual head of government and head/owner of the executive power.
In such systems, the head of state or their official representative  usually holds a largely 
ceremonial position, although often with reserve powers.
