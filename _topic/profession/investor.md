# Profession: investor

An investor is a person that allocates capital with the expectation of a future financial return  
or to gain an advantage .
Through this allocated capital most of the time the investor purchases some species of property.
Types of investments include equity, debt, securities, real estate, infrastructure, currency, 
commodity, token, derivatives such as put and call options, futures, forwards, etc.
This definition makes no distinction between the investors in the primary and secondary markets.
 That is, someone who provides a business with capital and someone who buys a stock are both 
investors.
