# Profession: king

King is the title given to a male monarch in a variety of contexts. A king is an absolute monarch if he holds the powers of government without control, or the entire  sovereignty over a nation; he is a limited monarch if his power is restrained by fixed laws; and he  is an absolute, when he holds the whole legislative, judicial, and executive power, or when the  legislative or judicial powers, or both, are vested in other people by the king. Kings are hereditary sovereigns when they hold the powers of government by right of birth or  inheritance, and elective when raised to the throne by choice.
