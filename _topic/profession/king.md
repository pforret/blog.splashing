# Profession: king

King is the title given to a male monarch in a variety of contexts. The female equivalent is queen, which title is also given to the consort of a king, although in  some cases, the title of King is given to females to show that the woman in question rules in her  own right, such as in the case of Jadwiga of Poland, or Irene of Athens.
