# Profession: engineer

Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build 
and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional 
objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, 
safety and cost.
The word engineer  is derived from the Latin words ingeniare  and ingenium .
The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in 
an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline 
plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice  and passage of engineering board 
examinations.
