# Profession: janitor

A janitor, also known as a janny, custodian, porter, cleanser, cleaner or caretaker is a person who 
cleans and maintains buildings.
Janitors typically earn an average wage of $15 per hour in the United States.
That translates to an annual salary of around $35,000 for states that pay janitors the most, such 
as New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.
In some cases, they will also carry out maintenance and security duties.
A similar position, but usually with more managerial duties and not including cleaning, is occupied 
by building superintendents in the United States and  Canada and by site managers in schools in the 
United Kingdom.
