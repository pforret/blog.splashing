# negroni

The negroni is a cocktail, made of equal parts gin, vermouth rosso, and Campari, generally served  on the rocks, and commonly garnished with an orange slice or orange peel. It is considered an apéritif.  The drink has been documented in Italy since the late 1940s, and became popular in the 1950s, but  the origin is uncertain, and early recipes differ somewhat from the modern standard. The basic recipe – an equal-parts cocktail of these three ingredients – is first recorded in French  cocktail books of the late 1920s, alongside many similar drinks; in Italy a long drink of equal  parts vermouth and Campari, topped with soda and served over ice, has existed since the 1800s under  the names Milano–Torino or Americano.
