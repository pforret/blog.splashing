# caipirinha

Caipirinha  is Brazil's national cocktail from São Paulo, made with cachaça, sugar, and lime. The drink is prepared by mixing the fruit and the sugar together, then adding the liquor. This can be made in a single large glass to be shared among people, or in a larger jar, from which  it is served in individual glasses.
