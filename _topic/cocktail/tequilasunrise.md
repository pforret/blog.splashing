# tequila sunrise

The tequila sunrise is a cocktail made of tequila, orange juice, and grenadine syrup. The drink is served unmixed in a tall glass. The modern drink originates from Sausalito, California, in the early 1970s after an earlier  iteration created in the 1930s in Phoenix, Arizona. The cocktail is named for its appearance when servedâ€”with gradations of color resembling a sunrise.
