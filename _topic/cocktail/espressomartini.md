# espresso martini

The espresso martini, also known as a vodka espresso, is a cold caffeinated alcoholic drink made  with espresso, coffee liqueur, and vodka. It is not a true martini as it contains neither gin nor vermouth, but is one of many drinks that  incorporate the term martini into their names.
