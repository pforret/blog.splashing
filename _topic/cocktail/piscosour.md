# pisco sour

A pisco sour is an alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian origin that is traditional to Peruvian cuisine  and Chilean cuisine. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, about sour  citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime  juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and  egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as  coca leaves.
