# Micronesia

Micronesia  is a subregion of Oceania, consisting of about two thousand small islands in the 
western Pacific Ocean.
It has a close shared cultural history with three other island regions: the Philippines to the 
west, Polynesia to the east, and Melanesia to the south—as well as with the wider community of 
Austronesian peoples.

The region has a tropical marine climate and is part of the Oceanian realm.
It includes four main archipelagos—the Caroline Islands, the Gilbert Islands, the Mariana Islands, 
and the Marshall Islands—as well as numerous islands that are not part of any archipelago.
