# Iceland

Iceland  is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean and the most sparsely populated 
country in Europe.
Iceland's capital and largest city is Reykjav√≠k, which  is home to over 65% of the population.
Iceland is the only part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that rises above sea level, and its central 
volcanic plateau is erupting almost constantly.
The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, 
and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands.
Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just 
outside the Arctic Circle.
