# Djibouti

Djibouti, officially the Republic of Djibouti, is a country in the Horn of Africa, bordered by  Somalia to the south, Ethiopia to the southwest, Eritrea in the north, and the Red Sea and the Gulf  of Aden to the east. The country has an area of 23,200 km2 .In antiquity, the territory, together with Ethiopia, Eritrea  and Somaliland, was part of the Land of Punt. Nearby Zeila, now in Somaliland, was the seat of the medieval Adal and Ifat Sultanates. In the late 19th century, the colony of French Somaliland was established after the ruling Dir  Somali sultans signed treaties with the French, and its railroad to Dire Dawa  allowed it to  quickly supersede Zeila as the port for southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden. It was renamed the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas in 1967.
