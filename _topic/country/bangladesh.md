# Bangladesh

Bangladesh, officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia.
It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding 163 million people 
in an area of either 148,460 square kilometres  or 147,570 square kilometres, making it one of the 
most densely populated countries in the world.
Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the 
southeast; to the south it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal.
It is narrowly separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by 100 km 
of the Indian state of Sikkim in the north.
Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political, and cultural hub.
