# Mongolia

Mongolia  is a landlocked country in East Asia, bordered by Russia to the north and China to the  south. It covers an area of 1,564,116 square kilometres, with a population of just 3.3 million, making it  the world's most sparsely populated sovereign state. Mongolia is the world's largest landlocked country that does not border a closed sea, and much of  its area is covered by grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to  the south. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to roughly half of the country's population.
