# Albania

Albania, officially the Republic of Albania, is a country in Southeast Europe. The country is located in the Balkans on the Adriatic and Ionian Seas within the Mediterranean Sea  and shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia  to the east and Greece to the south. Spanning an area of 28,748 km2, it displays a varied range of climatic, geological, hydrological  and morphological conditions. The country's landscapes range from rugged snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps and the  Korab, Skanderbeg, Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains, to fertile lowland plains extending from the  coasts of the Adriatic and Ionian seas. Tirana is the capital and largest city in the country, followed by Durrës, Vlorë, and Shkodër.
