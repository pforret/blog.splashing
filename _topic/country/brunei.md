# Brunei

Brunei, formally Brunei Darussalam, is a country in Southeast Asia, situated on the northern coast  of the island of Borneo. Apart from its coastline on the South China Sea, it is completely surrounded by the Malaysian state  of Sarawak, with its territory bifurcated by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state entirely on Borneo; the remainder of the island is divided  between its multi-landmass neighbours of Malaysia and Indonesia. As of 2020 the country had a population of 460,345, of whom approximately 100,000 resided in the  capital and largest city Bandar Seri Begawan. The government of Brunei is an absolute monarchy ruled by the Sultan of Brunei, and it implements a  fusion of English common law and jurisprudence inspired by Islam, including sharia.
