# Cameroon

Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in west-central Africa.
It is bordered by Nigeria to the west and north; Chad to the northeast; the Central African 
Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south.
Its coastline lies on the Bight of Biafra, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean.
The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African, due to its 
strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa.
Its nearly 25 million people speak 250 native languages.Early inhabitants of the territory included 
the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad, and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest.
