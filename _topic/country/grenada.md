The southernmost of the Windward Islands, Grenada is directly south of Saint Vincent and the  Grenadines and about 100 miles north of Trinidad and the South American mainland.   Grenada consists of the island of Grenada itself, two smaller islands, Carriacou and Petite  Martinique, and several small islands which lie to the north of the main island and are a part of  the Grenadines.
