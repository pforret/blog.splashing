# Guinea-Bissau

Guinea-Bissau, officially the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, is a country in West Africa that covers  36,125 square kilometres  with an estimated population of 2,026,778. It borders Senegal to its north and Guinea to its southeast.Guinea-Bissau was once part of the  kingdom of Kaabu, as well as part of the Mali Empire. Parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century, while a few others were under some rule by  the Portuguese Empire since the 16th century. In the 19th century, it was colonised as Portuguese Guinea. Portuguese control was restricted and weak until the early 20th century when pacification campaigns  solidified Portuguese sovereignty in the area.
