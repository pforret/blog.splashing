Kazakhstan, officially the Republic of Kazakhstan, is a transcontinental country located mainly in 
Central Asia and partly in Eastern Europe.
It borders Russia to the north and west, China to the east, Kyrgyzstan to the southeast, Uzbekistan 
to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southwest.
Its capital is Nur-Sultan, formerly known as Astana until 2019.
Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, was the country's capital until 1997.
Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, the world's largest Muslim-majority country 
by land area, and the ninth-largest country in the world overall.
