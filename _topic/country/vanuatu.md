# Vanuatu

Vanuatu, officially the Republic of Vanuatu, is an island country in Melanesia, located in the  South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is 1,750 km  east of northern Australia, 540 km   northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji.  Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator  Fernandes de Queirós, who arrived on the largest island, Espíritu Santo, in 1606.
