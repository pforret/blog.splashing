Montenegro  is a country in Southeast Europe, located in the Balkans. It is bordered by Bosnia and Herzegovina to the north, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east,  Albania to the southeast, and Croatia and the Adriatic Sea to the northwest with a coastline of  293.5 km. Podgorica  is the country's capital and its largest city; it covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory  of 13,812 square kilometres, and is home to roughly 31% of its total population of 621,000. Cetinje  is the former royal capital and cultural centre  of Montenegro and is the location of  several national institutions, including the official residence of the President of  Montenegro.During the Early Medieval period, three principalities were located on the territory of  modern-day Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and  Rascia proper, the north. The Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries.
