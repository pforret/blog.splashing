# Montenegro

Montenegro  is a country in Southeastern Europe. It is a part of the Balkans and is bordered by Serbia to the northeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina to  the north, Kosovo to the east, Albania to the southeast, Croatia to the northwest, and the Adriatic  Sea to the west with a coastline of 293.5 km. Podgorica, the capital and largest city, covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory of 13,812 square  kilometres, and is home to roughly 30% of its total population of 621,000.During the Early Medieval  period, three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro: Duklja,  roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and Rascia proper, the north. The Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the late 14th century to the late 18th century, large parts of southern Montenegro were ruled  by the Venetian Republic and incorporated into Venetian Albania.
