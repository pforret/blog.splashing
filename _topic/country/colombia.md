# Colombia

Colombia, officially the Republic of Colombia, is a country in South America with insular regions  in North America—near Nicaragua's Caribbean coast—as well as in the Pacific Ocean. The Colombian mainland is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north, Venezuela to the east and  northeast, Brazil to the southeast, Ecuador and Peru to the south and southwest, the Pacific Ocean  to the west, and Panama to the northwest. Colombia is divided into 32 departments and the Capital District of Bogotá, the country's largest  city. It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers, and has a population of 52 million. Colombia's cultural heritage—including language, religion, cuisine, and art—reflects its history as  a Spanish colony, fusing cultural elements brought by immigration from Europe and the Middle East,  with those brought by enslaved Africans, as well as with those of the various Indigenous  civilizations that predate colonization.
