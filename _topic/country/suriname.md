Suriname, officially the Republic of Suriname, is a country in northern South America, sometimes  considered part of the Caribbean and the West Indies. Situated slightly north of the equator, over 90% of its territory is covered by rainforests, the  highest proportion of forest cover in the world. Suriname is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, French Guiana to the east, Guyana to the  west, and Brazil to the south. It is the smallest country in South America by both population and territory, with around 612,985  inhabitants in an area of approximately 163,820 square kilometers . The capital and largest city is Paramaribo, which is home to roughly half the population.
