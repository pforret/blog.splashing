# Switzerland

Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country at the confluence of 
Western, Central and Southern Europe.
The country is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern.
Switzerland is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria 
and Liechtenstein to the east.
It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura, spanning a total area 
of 41,285 km2  and land area of 39,997 km2 .
Although the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 
8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres 
are, among them ZÃ¼rich, Geneva and Basel.
