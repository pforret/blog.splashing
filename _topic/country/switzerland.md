# Switzerland

Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country located in west-central  Europe. It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and  Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps  occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's population of 9 million are  concentrated on the plateau, which hosts the largest cities and economic centres, including ZÃ¼rich,  Geneva and Basel.Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late  Middle Ages, following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy; the Federal  Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in  1648. Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality since the 16th century and has not fought  an international war since 1815.
