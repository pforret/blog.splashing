# Burundi

Burundi, officially the Republic of Burundi, is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley where 
the African Great Lakes region and East Africa converge.
It is bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and southeast, and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo to the west; Lake Tanganyika lies along its southwestern border.
The capital cities are Gitega and Bujumbura, the latter of which is the country's largest city.The 
Twa, Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years.
For more than 200 of those years, Burundi was an independent kingdom, until the beginning of the 
20th century, when Germany ruled the region.
After the First World War and Germany's defeat, the League of Nations mandated the territory to 
Belgium.
