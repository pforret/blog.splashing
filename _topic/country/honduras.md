# Honduras

Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a country in Central America.
The republic of Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to 
the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the 
north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea.
Its capital and largest city is Tegucigalpa.

Honduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures, most notably the Maya, before the 
Spanish Colonization in the sixteenth century.
