Tanzania, officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in East Africa within the 
African Great Lakes region.
It borders Uganda to the north; Kenya to the northeast; Comoro Islands and the Indian Ocean to the 
east; Mozambique and Malawi to the south; Zambia to the southwest; and Rwanda, Burundi, and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west.
Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania.

Many important hominid fossils have been found in Tanzania, such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene 
hominid fossils.
