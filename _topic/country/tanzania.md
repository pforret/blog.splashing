# Tanzania

Tanzania, officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in East Africa within the  African Great Lakes region. It borders Uganda to the north; Kenya to the northeast; the Indian Ocean to the east; Mozambique  and Malawi to the south; Zambia to the southwest; and Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic  of the Congo to the west. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. According to the 2022 national census, Tanzania has a population of nearly 62 million, making it  the most populous country located entirely south of the equator.Many important hominid fossils have  been found in Tanzania, such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene hominid fossils. In the Stone and Bronze Age, prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic  speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania  from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago; and the Southern Nilotes, including the  Datoog, who originated from the present-day South Sudan–Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and  2,400 years ago.: page 18  These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of  the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas.
