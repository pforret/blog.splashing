# North Korea

North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and shares borders with China and Russia  to the north, at the Yalu  and Tumen rivers, and South Korea to the south at the Korean  Demilitarized Zone. North Korea's border with South Korea is a disputed border as both countries claim the entirety of  the Korean Peninsula. The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by  the Sea of Japan. North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire  peninsula and adjacent islands.
