# North Korea

North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders China and Russia to the north  at the Yalu  and Tumen rivers, and South Korea to the south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by  the Sea of Japan. North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire  peninsula and adjacent islands. Pyongyang is the capital and largest city.
