# Moldova

Moldova, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a country in Eastern Europe.
It is bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south.
Ukraine and Moldova reached an agreement in 2005 ensuring Moldova's access to the Black Sea and 
ending its landlocked status.
The unrecognised breakaway region of Transnistria lies across the Dniester on the country's eastern 
border with Ukraine.
Moldova's capital and largest city is Chișinău.
