# Netherlands

The Netherlands, informally Holland, is a country located in Northwestern Europe with overseas 
territories in the Caribbean.
It is the largest of four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
In Europe, the Netherlands consists of twelve provinces, and borders Germany to the east, Belgium 
to the south, with a North Sea coast-line to the north and west.
It also shares maritime borders with both countries and with the United Kingdom in the North Sea.
The Caribbean overseas territories—Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba—became special municipalities 
of the country of the Netherlands in 2010.
