# Paraguay

Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a country in South America.
It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and 
Bolivia to the northwest.
It has a population of 7 million, nearly 3 million of whom live in the capital and largest city of 
Asunción, and its surrounding metro.
Although one of only two landlocked countries in South America, Paraguay has ports on the Paraguay 
and Paraná rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean, through the Paraná-Paraguay 
Waterway.Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524, and in 1537 established the city of Asunción, the 
first capital of the Governorate of the Río de la Plata.
During the 17th century, Paraguay was the center of Jesuit missions, where the native Guaraní 
people were converted to Christianity and introduced to European culture.
