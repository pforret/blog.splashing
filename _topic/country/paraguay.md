# Paraguay

Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in South America. It is bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and  Bolivia to the northwest. It has a population of around 6.1 million, nearly 2.3 million of whom live in the capital and  largest city of Asunción, and its surrounding metro area.  Spanish conquistadores arrived in 1524, and in 1537 established the city of Asunción, the first  capital of the Governorate of the Río de la Plata.
