# Uzbekistan

Uzbekistan, officially the Republic of Uzbekistan, is a country located in Central Asia. It is surrounded by five countries: Kazakhstan to the north, Kyrgyzstan to the northeast,  Tajikistan to the southeast, Afghanistan to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southwest, making it  one of only two doubly landlocked countries on Earth, along with Liechtenstein. Uzbekistan is part of the Turkic world, as well as a member of the Organization of Turkic States. Uzbek is the majority language, while Russian is widely spoken and understood. Islam is the predominant religion, and most Uzbeks are Sunni Muslims.The first recorded settlers in  the land of what is modern Uzbekistan were Eastern Iranian nomads, known as Scythians, who founded  kingdoms in Khwarazm, Bactria, and Sogdia in the 8th–6th centuries BC, as well as Fergana and  Margiana in the 3rd century BC – 6th century AD.
