# Benin

Benin, officially the Republic of Benin  and formerly known as Dahomey, is a country in West Africa.
It is bordered by Togo to the west, Nigeria to the east, Burkina Faso to the north-west, and Niger 
to the north-east.
The majority of its population lives on the small southern coastline of the Bight of Benin, part of 
the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean.
The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo, but the seat of government is in Cotonou, the country's largest 
city and economic capital.
Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometres  and its population in 2018 was estimated to be 
approximately 11.49 million.
