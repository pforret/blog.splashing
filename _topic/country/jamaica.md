# Jamaica

Jamaica  is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea. Spanning 10,990 square kilometres  in area, it is the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles  and the Caribbean . Jamaica lies about 145 kilometres  south of Cuba, and 191 kilometres  west of Hispaniola ; the  British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 kilometres  to the  north-west.Originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta√≠no peoples, the island came under Spanish rule  following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish  brought large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England  conquered it, renaming it  Jamaica.
