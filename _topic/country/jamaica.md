# Jamaica

Jamaica  is an island country in the Caribbean Sea and the West Indies. At 10,990 square kilometres, it is the third largest island—after Cuba and Hispaniola—of the  Greater Antilles and the Caribbean. Jamaica lies about 145 km  south of Cuba, 191 km  west of Hispaniola, and 215 km  south-east of the  Cayman Islands .First inhabited by the indigenous Taíno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule  after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish  brought large numbers of Africans to Jamaica as slaves. The island remained a possession of Spain, under the name Santiago, until 1655, when England   conquered it and named it Jamaica.
