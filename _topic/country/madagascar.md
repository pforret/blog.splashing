# Madagascar

Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, 
is an island country in the Indian Ocean, approximately 400 kilometres  off the coast of East 
Africa across the Mozambique Channel.
At 592,800 square kilometres  Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after 
Indonesia.
The nation consists of the island of Madagascar  and numerous smaller peripheral islands.
Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian 
subcontinent around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative 
isolation.
Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is endemic.
