# Madagascar

Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar  is an island country in the Indian Ocean,  approximately 400 kilometres  off the coast of East Africa across the Mozambique Channel. At 592,800 square kilometres, it is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.Home  to around 30 million people, it consists of the island of Madagascar  and numerous smaller  peripheral islands.   Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian  subcontinent around 90 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative  isolation.
