# Portugal

Portugal, officially the Portuguese Republic, is a country whose mainland is located on the Iberian 
Peninsula of Southwestern Europe, and whose territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of 
the Azores and Madeira.
It features the westernmost point in mainland Europe, and its Iberian portion is bordered to the 
west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain, the sole country to have a 
land border with Portugal.
Its two archipelagos form two autonomous regions with their own regional governments.
The official and national language is Portuguese.
Lisbon is the capital and largest city.
