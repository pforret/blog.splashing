# Ireland

Ireland  is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western Europe. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's  Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the  twentieth-largest on Earth.Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland,  which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million living in  the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous  island in Europe after Great Britain.The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying  mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in  temperature.
