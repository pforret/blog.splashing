# Chad

Chad, officially known as the Republic of Chad, is a landlocked country at the crossroads of North 
and Central Africa.
It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, 
Cameroon to the south-west, Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west.
Chad has a population of 16 million, of which 1.6 million live in the capital and largest city 
N'Djamena.

Chad has several regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a 
more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south.
