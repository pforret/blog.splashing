# Togo

Togo, officially the Togolese Republic, is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north. It is one of the least developed countries and extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, where its  capital, Lom√©, is located. It is a small, tropical country, which covers 57,000 square kilometres  and has a population of  approximately 8 million, and it has a width of less than 115 km  between Ghana and its eastern  neighbour Benin.Various people groups settled the boundaries of present day Togo between the 11th  and 16th centuries. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the coastal region served primarily as a European slave  trading outpost, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name The Slave Coast.
