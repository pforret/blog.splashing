Togo, officially the Togolese Republic, is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north. It extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, where its capital, Lom√©, is located. It covers about 57,000 square kilometres  with a population of approximately 8 million, and has a  width of less than 115 km  between Ghana and its eastern neighbor Benin.From the 11th to the 16th  century, tribes entered the region from various directions. From the 16th century to the 18th century, the coastal region was a trading center for Europeans to  purchase slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name The Slave Coast.
