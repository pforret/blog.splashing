# Andorra

Andorra, officially the Principality of Andorra, is a sovereign landlocked microstate on the 
Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern Pyrenees, bordered by France to the north and Spain to the south.
Believed to have been created by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, 
when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell.
The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278.
It is headed by two co-princes: the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain and the President of 
France.
Its capital and largest city is Andorra la Vella.
