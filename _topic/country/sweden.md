Sweden, formally the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Nordic country located on the Scandinavian Peninsula  in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the  southwest by a bridge–tunnel across the Öresund. At 447,425 square kilometres, Sweden is the largest Nordic country, the third-largest country in  the European Union, and the fifth-largest country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Stockholm. Sweden has a total population of 10.5 million, and a low population density of 25.5 inhabitants per  square kilometre, with around 87% of Swedes residing in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire  land area, in the central and southern half of the country.
