# New Zealand

New Zealand  is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island  and the South Island —and over 700 smaller 
islands.
It is the sixth-largest island country, covering a total area of 268,021 square kilometres .
New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres  east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres 
 south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga.
The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to 
tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions.
