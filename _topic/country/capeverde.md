# Cape Verde

Cape Verde  or Cabo Verde, officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an archipelago and island 
country in the central Atlantic Ocean, consisting of ten volcanic islands with a combined land area 
of about 4,033 square kilometres .
These islands lie between 600 to 850 kilometres  west of Cap-Vert, the westernmost point of 
continental Africa.
The Cape Verde islands form part of the Macaronesia ecoregion, along with the Azores, the Canary 
Islands, Madeira, and the Savage Isles.

The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century, when Portuguese explorers 
discovered and colonized the islands, thus establishing the first European settlement in the 
tropics.
