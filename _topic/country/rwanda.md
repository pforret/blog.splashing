# Rwanda

Rwanda  , is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley of Central Africa, where the African  Great Lakes region and Southeast Africa converge. Located a few degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and  the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is highly elevated, giving it the soubriquet land of a thousand hills, with its geography  dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the southeast, with numerous lakes throughout the  country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. It is the most densely populated mainland African country; among countries larger than 10,000 km2,  it is the fifth most densely populated country in the world.
