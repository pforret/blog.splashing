# Israel

Israel, officially the State of Israel, is a country in Western Asia.
It is situated on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red 
Sea, and shares borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, and 
Egypt to the southwest; it is also bordered by the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively.
Tel Aviv is the economic and technological center of the country, while its seat of government is 
in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is 
unrecognized internationally.Israel has evidence of the earliest hominid migrations out of Africa.
Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested in the region since the Middle Bronze Age, while the 
kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age.
The northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire around 720 BCE, and the 
Kingdom of Judah was incorporated into the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE.
