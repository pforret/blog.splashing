# Israel

Israel, officially the State of Israel, is a country in the Levant region of West Asia. It is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, the Red Sea to  the south, Egypt to the southwest, the Mediterranean Sea to the west, and the Palestinian  territories â€“ the West Bank along the east and the Gaza Strip along the southwest. Tel Aviv is the financial, economic, and technological center of the country, while its seat of  government is in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East  Jerusalem is unrecognized internationally.Israel is located in a region known historically as  Canaan, Palestine, and the Holy Land. In antiquity, it was home to several Canaanite, and later,  Israelite and Jewish kingdoms, and is  referred to as the Land of Israel in Jewish tradition. The region was then ruled by the Assyrian, Babylonian, Achaemenid, Greek, Roman, Byzantine,  Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Crusader, and Ottoman empires.
