# Ecuador

Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador, is a country in northwestern South America, bordered  by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometers  west of the  mainland. The country's capital is  Quito, but its largest city is Guayaquil.  The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of indigenous peoples that were  gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century.
