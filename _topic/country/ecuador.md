# Ecuador

Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador, is a country in northwestern South America, bordered 
by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west.
Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometers  west of the 
mainland.
The capital is Quito.The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of 
Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century.
The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century, achieving independence in 1820 as 
part of Gran Colombia, from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830.
The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador's ethnically diverse population, with most of 
its 17.1 million people being mestizos, followed by large minorities of European, Native American, 
and African descendants.
