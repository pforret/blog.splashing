# Vatican City

Vatican City, officially the Vatican City State, is an independent city-state and enclave 
surrounded by Rome, Italy.
The Vatican City State, also known simply as the Vatican, became independent from Italy with the 
Lateran Treaty, and it is a distinct territory under full ownership, exclusive dominion, and 
sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity of international 
law, which maintains the city state's temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual independence.
With an area of 49 hectares  and a population of about 825, it is the smallest state in the world 
by both area and population.
As governed by the Holy See, the Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical 
state  ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church.
The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins.
