# Spain

Spain  or the Kingdom of Spain, is a country in southwestern Europe with parts of territory in the 
Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean Sea.
The largest part of Spain is situated on the Iberian Peninsula; its territory also includes the 
Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the autonomous 
cities of Ceuta and Melilla, and several minor overseas territories also scattered along the 
Moroccan coast of the Alboran Sea.
The country's mainland is bordered to the south by Gibraltar; to the south and east by the 
Mediterranean Sea; to the north by France, Andorra and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by 
Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean.

With an area of 505,990 km2, Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second-largest 
country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth-largest country by area on the 
European continent.
