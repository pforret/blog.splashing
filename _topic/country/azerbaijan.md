It is a part of the South Caucasus region and is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia  to  the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia and Turkey to the west, and Iran to the south. Baku is the capital and largest city.  The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence from the Transcaucasian Democratic  Federative Republic in 1918 and became the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state.
