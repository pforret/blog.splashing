# Senegal

Senegal  officially the Republic of Senegal, is the westernmost country in continental Africa,  situated on the Atlantic Ocean coastline. Senegal is bordered by Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast and  Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal nearly surrounds The Gambia, a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of  the Gambia River, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the  country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with Cape Verde. Senegal's economic and political capital is Dakar.
