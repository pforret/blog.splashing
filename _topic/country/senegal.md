# Senegal

Senegal, officially the Republic of Senegal  is a country in West Africa.
It is bordered by Mauritania in the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast, and 
Guinea-Bissau to the southwest.
It nearly surrounds The Gambia, a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the 
Gambia River, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country.
Senegal also shares a maritime border with Cape Verde.
Its economic and political capital is Dakar.
