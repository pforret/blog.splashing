# Panama

Panama, officially the Republic of Panama, is a transcontinental country in Latin America, spanning  the southern tip of Central America into the northern part of South America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the  north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Its capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the  country's over 4 million inhabitants.Before the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century,  Panama was inhabited by a number of different indigenous tribes. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva  Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of  Colombia.
