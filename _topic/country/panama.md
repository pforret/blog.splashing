# Panama

Panama, officially the Republic of Panama, is a transcontinental country in Central America and 
South America, bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to 
the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south.
Its capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the 
country's 4 million people.Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists 
arrived in the 16th century.
It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva 
Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela.
After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of 
Colombia.
With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the 
construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers 
between 1904 and 1914.
