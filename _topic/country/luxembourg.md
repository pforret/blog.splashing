# Luxembourg

Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a small landlocked country in Western  Europe. It borders Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital and most populous city, Luxembourg, is one of the four institutional seats of the  European Union  and the seat of several EU institutions, notably the Court of Justice of the  European Union, the highest judicial authority. Luxembourg's culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its French and German  neighbors; while Luxembourgish is legally the only national language of the Luxembourgish people,  French and German are also used in administrative and judicial matters and all three are considered  administrative languages of the country.With an area of 2,586 square kilometers, Luxembourg is one  of the smallest countries in Europe, and the smallest not considered a microstate. In 2022, it had a population of 645,397, which makes it one of the least-populated countries in  Europe, albeit with the highest population growth rate; foreigners account for nearly half the  population.
