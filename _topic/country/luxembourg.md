# Luxembourg

Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in Western Europe.
It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south.
Its capital, Luxembourg City, is one of the four official capitals of the European Union  and the 
seat of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the highest judicial authority in the EU.
Its culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it a mixture 
of French and German cultures.
Luxembourgish is the only national language of the Luxembourgish people, as defined by law.
