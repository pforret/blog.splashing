# Luxembourg

Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a small landlocked country in Western  Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital and most populous city, Luxembourg, is one of the four institutional seats of the  European Union  and the seat of several EU institutions, notably the Court of Justice of the  European Union, the highest judicial authority. Luxembourg's culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its French and German  neighbors; while Luxembourgish is the only national language of the Luxembourgish people and of the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, French is the only language for legislation, and all three –  Luxembourgish, French and German – are used for administrative matters in the country.With an area  of 2,586 square kilometers, Luxembourg is Europe's seventh-smallest country. In 2023, it had a population of 660,809, which makes it one of the least-populated countries in  Europe, albeit with the highest population growth rate; foreigners account for nearly half the  population.
