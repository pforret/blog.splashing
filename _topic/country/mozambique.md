# Mozambique

Mozambique, officially the Republic of Mozambique, is a country located in southeast Africa  bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the  northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Eswatini and South Africa to the southwest. The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros, Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel  to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo.  Between the 7th and 11th centuries, a series of Swahili port towns developed on that area, which  contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and dialect.
