# Mozambique

Mozambique (, officially the Republic of Mozambique, is a country located in Southeastern Africa 
bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the 
northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Eswatini  and South Africa to the southwest.
The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros, Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel 
to the east.
The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo .

Between the first and fifth centuries AD, Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique 
from farther north and west.
