# Myanmar

Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, also known as Burma, is a country in  Southeast Asia. It is the largest country by area in Mainland Southeast Asia and has a population of about 55  million. It is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to its northeast, Laos and Thailand  to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest. The country's capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon .Early civilisations in the  area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in  Lower Myanmar. In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the  establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture, and Theravada  Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country.
