# Namibia

Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia, is a country in Southern Africa.
Its western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa 
to the south and east.
Although it does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres  of the Botswanan right bank of the 
Zambezi River separates the two countries.
Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of 
Independence.
