# Kosovo

Kosovo, officially the Republic of Kosovo, is a partially recognised state in Southeast Europe.
It lies at the centre of the Balkans, occupying an area of 10,887 km2, with a population of about 
1.8 million.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, and has since gained 
diplomatic recognition as a sovereign state by 97 member states of the United Nations.
It is bordered by Serbia to the north and east, North Macedonia to the southeast, Albania to the 
southwest, and Montenegro to the west.
Most of central Kosovo is dominated by the vast plains and fields of Metohija and Kosovo.
