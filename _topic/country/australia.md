# Australia

Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland 
of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.
With an area of 7,617,930 square kilometres, Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania 
and the world's sixth-largest country.
Australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils.
It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with 
deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the 
south-east.
