Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger;  to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north  by the Mediterranean Sea. It is considered part of the Maghreb region of North Africa. It has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the  Sahara dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres, making it the world's tenth largest nation  by area, and the largest nation in Africa, more than 200 times as large as the continent's smallest  country, The Gambia.
