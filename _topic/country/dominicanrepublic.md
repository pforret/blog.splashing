# Dominican Republic

The Dominican Republic  is a country on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles  archipelago of the Caribbean Sea, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with Haiti, making Hispaniola  one of only two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that is shared by two sovereign states. It is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area  at 48,671 square kilometers, and  second-largest by population, with approximately 11.4 million people in 2024, of whom approximately  3.6 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.The native Taíno  people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of Europeans, dividing it into five chiefdoms. Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island for Castile, landing there on his first voyage  in 1492. The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the  Americas and the first seat of Spanish colonial rule in the New World.
