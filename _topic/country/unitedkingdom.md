The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom  or 
Britain, is a sovereign country in north-western Europe, off the north-­western coast of the 
European mainland.
The United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north-­eastern part of the island of 
Ireland, and many smaller islands within the British Isles.
Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland.
Otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east, 
the English Channel to the south and the Celtic Sea to the south-west, giving it the 12th-longest 
coastline in the world.
The Irish Sea separates Great Britain and Ireland.
