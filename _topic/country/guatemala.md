# Guatemala

Guatemala, officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America. It is bordered to the north and west by Mexico, to the northeast by Belize, to the east by  Honduras, and to the southeast by El Salvador. It is hydrologically bordered to the south by the Pacific Ocean and to the northeast by the Gulf of  Honduras.  The territory of modern Guatemala hosted the core of the Maya civilization, which extended across  Mesoamerica; in the 16th century, most of this was conquered by the Spanish and claimed as part of  the viceroyalty of New Spain.
