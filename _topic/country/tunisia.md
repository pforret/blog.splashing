# Tunisia

Tunisia, officially the Republic of Tunisia, is the northernmost country in Africa.
It is a part of the Maghreb region of North Africa, and is bordered by Algeria to the west and 
southwest, Libya to the southeast, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east; covering 
163,610 km2, with a population of 11 million.
It contains the eastern end of the Atlas Mountains and the northern reaches of the Sahara desert, 
with much of its remaining territory arable land.
Its 1,300 km  of coastline include the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the 
Mediterranean Basin.
Tunisia is home to Africa's northernmost point, Cape Angela; and its capital and largest city is 
Tunis, located on its northeastern coast, which lends the country its name.
