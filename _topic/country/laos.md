# Laos

Laos, officially the Lao People's Democratic Republic,, is a socialist state and the only 
landlocked country in Southeast Asia.
At the heart of the Indochinese Peninsula, Laos is bordered by Myanmar and the People's Republic of 
China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the southeast, and Thailand to the west 
and southwest.
Its capital and largest city is Vientiane.

Present-day Laos traces its historic and cultural identity to Lan Xang, which existed from the 14th 
century to the 18th century as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia.
