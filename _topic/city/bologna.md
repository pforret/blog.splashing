# Bologna

Bologna  is the capital and largest city of the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy, with about 400,000 inhabitants and 150 different  nationalities. Its metropolitan area is home to more than 1,000,000 people. It is known as the Fat City for its rich cuisine, and the Red City for its red tiled rooftops and,  more recently, its leftist politics. It is also called the Learned City because it is home to the oldest university in the  world.Originally Etruscan, the city has been an important urban center for centuries, first under  the Etruscans, then under the Celts as Bona, later under the Romans, then again in the Middle Ages,  as a free municipality and later signoria, when it was among the largest European cities by  population.
