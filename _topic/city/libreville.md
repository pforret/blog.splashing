Libreville is the capital and largest city of Gabon.
Occupying 65 square kilometres  in the northwestern province of Estuaire, Libreville is a port on 
the Komo River, near the Gulf of Guinea.
As of the 2013 census, its population was 703,904.The area has been inhabited by the Mpongwe people 
since before the French acquired the land in 1839.
It was later an American Christian mission, and a slave resettlement site, before becoming the 
chief port of the colony of French Equatorial Africa.
By the time of Gabonese independence in 1960, the city was a trading post and minor administrative 
centre with a population of 32,000.
Since 1960, Libreville has grown rapidly and now is home to one-third of the national population.
