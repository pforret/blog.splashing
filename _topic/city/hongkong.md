# Hong Kong

Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of  China, is a city and a special administrative region in China. With 7.4 million residents of various nationalities in a 1,104-square-kilometre  territory, Hong  Kong is one of the most densely populated territories in the world.  Hong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing dynasty ceded Hong Kong  Island in 1841–1842 as a consequence of losing the First Opium War. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and was further extended when the United  Kingdom obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898.
