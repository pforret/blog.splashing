# Tbilisi

Tbilisi, in some languages still known by its pre-1936 name Tiflis,  is the capital and largest  city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of around 1.2 million  people. Tbilisi was founded in the fifth century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as  the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tiflis was the seat of the Caucasus  Viceroyalty, governing both the northern and the southern parts of the Caucasus.Because of its  location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road,  throughout history, Tbilisi has been a point of contention among various global powers. To this day, the city's location ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and  trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux  Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist, and Modern structures.
