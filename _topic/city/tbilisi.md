# Tbilisi

Tbilisi, in some languages still known by its pre-1936 name Tiflis, is the capital and the largest  city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population around 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the fifth century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as  the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tiflis was the seat of the Caucasus  Viceroyalty, governing both the northern and the southern parts of the Caucasus.  Because of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the  lucrative Silk Road, throughout history, Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global  powers.
