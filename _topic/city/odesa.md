# Odesa

Odesa  is the third most populous city and municipality in Ukraine and a major seaport and  transport hub located in the south-west of the country, on the northwestern shore of the Black Sea. The city is also the administrative centre of the Odesa Raion and Odesa Oblast, as well as a  multiethnic cultural centre. As of January 2021, Odesa's population was approximately 1,010,537. On 25 January 2023, its historic city centre was declared a World Heritage Site and added to the  List of World Heritage in Danger by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in recognition of its  influence on cinema, literature, and the arts. The declaration was made in response to the bombing of Odesa during the 2022 Russian invasion of  Ukraine, which has damaged or destroyed buildings across the city.
