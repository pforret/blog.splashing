# Odesa

Odesa  is the third most populous city and municipality in Ukraine and a major seaport and  transport hub located in the south-west of the country, on the northwestern shore of the Black Sea. The city is also the administrative centre of the Odesa Raion and Odesa Oblast, as well as a  multiethnic cultural centre. As of January 2021 Odesa's population was approximately 1,015,826.In classical antiquity a large  Greek settlement existed at its location. The first chronicle mention of the Slavic settlement-port of Kotsiubijiv, which was part of the  Grand Duchy of Lithuania, dates back to 1415, when a ship was sent from here to Constantinople by  sea. After a period of Lithuanian Grand Duchy control, the port and its surroundings became part of the  domain of the Ottomans in 1529, under the name Hacibey, and remained there until the empire's  defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1792.
