# Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires, officially the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, is the capital and largest city of 
Argentina.
The city is located on the western shore of the Río de la Plata, on South America's southeastern 
coast.
Buenos Aires can be translated as fair winds or good airs, but the former was the meaning intended 
by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name Real de Nuestra Señora Santa 
María del Buen Ayre, named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia, Italy.

The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; 
rather, it is an autonomous district.
In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from 
Buenos Aires Province.
