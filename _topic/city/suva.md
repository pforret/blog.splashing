# Suva

Suva  is the capital and largest city of Fiji. It is the home of the country's largest metropolitan area and serves as its major port. The city is located on the southeast coast of the island of Viti Levu, in Rewa Province, Central  Division.  In 1877, the capital of Fiji was moved to Suva from Levuka, the main European colonial settlement  at the time, due to its restrictive geography and environs.
