# Suva

Suva  is the capital of Fiji, and its largest metropolitan city.
It is located on the southeast coast of the island of Viti Levu, in Rewa Province, Central Division.

In 1877, it was decided to make Suva the capital of Fiji.
At that time, the colony was being administered from what had been the main European settlement:  
Levuka, on the Fijian island of Ovalau, in Lomaiviti Province.
But the geography of Luvuka and its environs had proven too restrictive.
