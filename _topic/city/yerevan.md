Yerevan  is the capital and largest city of Armenia, as well as one of the world's oldest  continuously inhabited cities. Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of  the country, as its primate city. It has been the capital since 1918, the fourteenth in the history of Armenia and the seventh  located in or around the Ararat Plain. The city also serves as the seat of the Araratian Pontifical Diocese, which is the largest diocese  of the Armenian Apostolic Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world.The history of Yerevan  dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King  Argishti I of Urartu at the western extreme of the Ararat Plain. Erebuni was designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.
