# Luhansk

Luhansk, also known as Lugansk, is a city in the Donbas region, eastern Ukraine. As of 2022, the population was estimated to be 397,677, making Luhansk the 12th-largest city in  Ukraine.  Luhansk served as the administrative center of Luhansk Oblast, before pro-Russian separatists  seized control of the city in 2014 and made it the capital of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's  Republic. The Ukrainian administration was located in Sievierodonetsk from 2014 to 2022 during the war in  Donbas, due to Ukraine not being in control of Luhansk.
