# Luhansk

Luhansk, also known as Lugansk, is a city in what is internationally recognised as Ukraine,  although it is administered by Russia as capital of the Luhansk People's Republic . As of 2022, the population was estimated to be 397,677, making Luhansk the most populous city in  the region and the 12th largest in Ukraine. In 2001, nearly half of the population was ethnically Ukrainian, and 47% was ethnically Russian.  Luhansk has been the capital and administrative center of Luhansk Oblast, although the Ukrainian  administration was relocated to Sievierodonetsk when the War in Donbas broke out following the  establishment of LPR.
