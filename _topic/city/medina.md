# Medina

Medina, officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah  and also commonly simplified as MadÄ«nah or Madinah, is 
the second-holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Medina Province of Saudi Arabia.
As of 2020, the estimated population of the city is 1,488,782, making it the fourth-most populous 
city in the country.
Located at the core of the Medina Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is 
distributed over 589 km2, of which 293 km2  constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is 
occupied by the Hejaz Mountains, empty valleys, agricultural spaces and older dormant volcanoes.

Medina is generally considered to be the cradle of Islamic culture and civilization.
The city is considered to be the second-holiest of three key cities in Islamic tradition, with 
Mecca and Jerusalem serving as the holiest and third-holiest cities, respectively.
