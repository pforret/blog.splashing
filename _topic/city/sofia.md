country.
The city is built west of the Iskar river, and has many mineral springs, such as the Sofia Central 
Mineral Baths.
It has a humid continental climate.
Being in the centre of the Balkans, it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, and 
closest to the Aegean Sea.Known as Serdica in Antiquity and Sredets in the Middle Ages, Sofia has 
been an area of human habitation since at least 7000 BC.
The recorded history of the city begins with the attestation of the conquest of Serdica by the 
Roman Republic in 29 BC from the Celtic tribe Serdi.
