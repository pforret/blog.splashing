# Bangkok

Bangkok, officially known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon and colloquially as Krung Thep, is the  capital and most populous city of Thailand. The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres  in the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and  has an estimated population of 10.539 million as of 2020, 15.3 percent of the country's population. Over 14 million people  lived within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region at the 2010  census, making Bangkok an extreme primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both  size and importance to the national economy.  Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century,  which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities, Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin  in 1782.
