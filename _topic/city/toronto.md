# Toronto

Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and the capital city of the Canadian province of  Ontario. With a population of 2,794,356 in 2021, it is the fourth-most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,765,188 people   surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a 2021  population of 6,712,341. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, sports and culture, and is one of  the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.Indigenous peoples have travelled  through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with  rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the  British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the  capital of Upper Canada.
