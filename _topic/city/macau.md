# Macau

Macau or Macao, officially the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of  China, is a city and special administrative region of China in the western Pearl River Delta by the  South China Sea. With a population of about 680,000 and an area of 32.9 km2, it is the most densely populated region  in the world.  Formerly a Portuguese colony, the territory of Portuguese Macau was first leased to Portugal as a  trading post by the Ming dynasty in 1557. Portugal paid an annual rent and administered the territory under Chinese sovereignty until 1887.
