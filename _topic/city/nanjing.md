# Nanjing

Nanjing, alternately romanized as Nanking, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's 
Republic of China, a sub-provincial city, a megacity and the second largest city in the East China 
region.
With 11 districts, Nanjing, which is located in southwestern Jiangsu, has an administrative area of 
6,600 km2  and a total recorded population of 9,314,685 as of 2020.
Nevertheless, its built-up  area encompassing 9 Nanjing urban Districts  and Huashan and Yushan 
Districts and Dangtu County in Maanshan City, largely being agglomerated, was home to 9,648,136 
inhabitants.
In a very few years, Jurong District in Zhenjiang and Jiujiang, Jinghu and Yijiang Districts in 
Wuhu will also be conurbated leading to a tri-city built-up area of 11,910,201 inhabitants.Situated 
in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, 
having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments 
dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, 
research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's 
largest inland ports.
The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's 
administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than 
that of a province.
Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength 
issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most 
sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta.
