# Nanjing

Nanjing, alternatively romanized as Nanking, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's  Republic of China. It is a sub-provincial city, and a megacity. The city has 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2, and a population of 9,423,400 as of  2021.  Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and  culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican  governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture,  education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of  the world's largest inland ports.
