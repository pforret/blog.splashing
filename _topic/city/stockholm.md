# Stockholm

Stockholm  is the capital and largest city of Sweden as well as the largest urban area in 
Scandinavia.
Approximately 980,000 people live in the municipality, with 1.6 million in the urban area, and 2.4 
million in the metropolitan area.
The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake Mälaren flows into the Baltic Sea.
Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago.
The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city 
in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl.
It is also the county seat of Stockholm County and for several hundred years was the capital of 
Finland as well  which then was a part of Sweden.
