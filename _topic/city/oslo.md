# Oslo

Oslo  is the capital and most populous city of Norway.
It constitutes both a county and a municipality.
The municipality of Oslo had a population of 698,660 in 2021, while the city's greater urban area 
had a population of 1,019,513 in 2019, and the metropolitan area had an estimated population of 
1.71 million in 2010.During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken.
Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in 1040 under the name Ánslo, and 
established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada.
The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300.
Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence.
