# Singapore

Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island city-state in maritime 
Southeast Asia.
It lies about one degree of latitude  north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay 
Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Riau Islands  to the south, and the 
South China Sea to the east.
The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one 
outlying islet, the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as 
a result of extensive land reclamation projects.
It has the third greatest population density in the world.
With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities, Singapore 
has four official languages; English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.
English is the lingua franca.
