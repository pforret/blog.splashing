# Singapore

Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island country and city-state in  maritime Southeast Asia. It lies about one degree of latitude  north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay  Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the  South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one  outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by 25% since the country's independence as  a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the third highest population density in the world. With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the  major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay,  Mandarin, and Tamil.
