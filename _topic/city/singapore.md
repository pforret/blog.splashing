# Singapore

Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is an island country and city-state in maritime  Southeast Asia. It is located about one degree of latitude  north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay  Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south along  with the Riau Islands in Indonesia, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor along  with the State of Johor in Malaysia to the north. The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one  outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's  independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are  numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic  groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and  Tamil.
