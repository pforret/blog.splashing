# Ho Chi Minh City

Ho Chi Minh City, formerly  known as Saigon, is the largest city in Vietnam.
Located in Southern Vietnam, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 km2 .

Prior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely populated area that had 
been part of historic empires of Funan, Chenla, and Cambodia.
With the arrival of Vietnamese, the area became more populated and officials began establishing the 
city from 1623 to 1698.
After it was ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to the French in 1862, the name Saigon was 
adopted and the city underwent urbanization to become a financial center in the region.
