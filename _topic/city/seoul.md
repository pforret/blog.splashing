# Seoul

Seoul, officially Seoul Special City, serves as the capital of South Korea, and is its most  extensive urban center. The broader Seoul Capital Area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon metropolitan city,  emerged as the world's fourth largest metropolitan economy in 2014, trailing only Tokyo, New York  City, and Los Angeles, hosting more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since  2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the South Korean government.
