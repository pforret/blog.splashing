# Valletta

Valletta  is the administrative unit and capital of Malta.
Located on the main island, between Marsamxett Harbour to the west and the Grand Harbour to the 
east, its population within administrative limits in 2014 was 6,444.
According to the data from 2020 by Eurostat, the Functional Urban Area and metropolitan region 
covered the whole island and has a population of 480 134.
Valletta is the southernmost capital of Europe, and at just 0.61 square kilometres, it is the 
European Union's smallest capital city.Valletta's 16th-century buildings were constructed by the 
Knights Hospitaller.
The city was named after Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from an 
Ottoman invasion during the Great Siege of Malta.
The city is Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern 
architecture, though the Second World War left major scars on the city, particularly the 
destruction of the Royal Opera House.
