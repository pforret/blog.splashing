# Hamburg

Hamburg, officially the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, is the second-largest city in Germany 
after Berlin, as well as the overall 7th largest city and largest non-capital city in the European 
Union with a population of over 1.84 million.
Hamburg's urban area has a population of around 2.5 million and its metropolitan area is home to 
more than five million people.
The city lies on the River Elbe and two of its tributaries, the River Alster and the River Bille.
One of Germany's 16 federated states, Hamburg is surrounded by Schleswig-Holstein to the north and 
Lower Saxony to the south.

The official name reflects Hamburg's history as a member of the medieval Hanseatic League and a 
free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire.
