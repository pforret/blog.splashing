# Dubai

Dubai  is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates  and the capital of the Emirate of 
Dubai.
Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the early 21st 
century into a cosmopolitan metropolis with a focus on tourism and hospitality.
Dubai is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.This can be accredited to Dubai's mix 
of cosmopolitan lifestyle and local culture.
As well as Dubai having the second most five-star hotels in the world and the tallest building in 
the world, the Burj Khalifa.
Because of upcoming competition and other reasons, the taller Creek Tower is being built to keep 
that title.Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, 
Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia.
It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.
