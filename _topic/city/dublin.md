# Dublin

Dublin  is the capital and largest city of Ireland.
Situated on a bay on the east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of 
Leinster and the Eastern and Midland Region.
It is bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range.
At the 2016 census, it had an urban area population of 1,173,179, while the population of the 
traditional County Dublin as a whole was 1,347,359.
The population of the Greater Dublin Area was 1,904,806.There is archaeological debate regarding 
precisely where and when Dublin originated, with a settlement established by the Gaels during or 
before the 7th century CE, and a second, Viking, settlement, following.
As the small Kingdom of Dublin, the city grew, and it became Ireland's principal settlement 
following the Norman invasion.
