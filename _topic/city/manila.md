# Manila

Manila, officially the City of Manila, is capital of the Philippines, and its second-most populous 
city.
It is highly urbanized and as of 2019 was the world's most densely populated city proper.
It was the first chartered city in the country, designated as such by the Philippine Commission Act 
183 of July 31, 1901.
It became autonomous with the passage of Republic Act No.
409, The Revised Charter of the City of Manila, on June 18, 1949.
Manila, Mexico City, and Madrid are considered the world's original set of global cities because 
Manila's commercial networks were the first to extend across the Pacific Ocean and connect Asia 
with the Spanish Americas.
