# Belfast

Belfast  is the capital and largest city of Northern Ireland, standing on the banks of the River 
Lagan on the east coast.
It is the 12th-largest city in the United Kingdom and the second-largest on the island of Ireland.
It had a population of 343,542 in 2019.
Belfast suffered greatly during the violence that accompanied the partition of Ireland, and 
especially during the more recent conflict known as the Troubles.

By the early 19th century, Belfast was a major port.
