# Belfast

Belfast  is the de facto capital city and principal port of Northern Ireland, standing on the banks  of the River Lagan and connected to the open sea through Belfast Lough and the North Channel. It is second to Dublin as the largest city in the island of Ireland with a population in 2021 of  345,418 and a metro area population of 671,559.Established as an English settlement early in the  17th century, its early growth was driven by Scottish-descendant Presbyterians. Their disaffection with Ireland's Anglican establishment contributed to the rebellion of 1798, and  to the union with Great Britainâ€”later regarded as a key to the town's industrial transformation. When granted city status in 1888, Belfast was the world's largest centre of linen manufacture, and  by the 1900s her shipyards were building up to a quarter of total United Kingdom tonnage.
