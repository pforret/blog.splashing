# Santiago

Santiago, also known as Santiago de Chile, is the capital and largest city of Chile as well as one 
of the largest cities in the Americas.
It is the center of Chile's most densely populated region, the Santiago Metropolitan Region, whose 
total population is 8 million, of which more than 6 million live in the city's continuous urban 
area.
The city is entirely in the country's central valley.
Most of the city lies between 500–650 m  above mean sea level.

Founded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, Santiago has been the capital city 
of Chile since colonial times.
