# Kinshasa

Kinshasa, formerly LÃ©opoldville, is the capital and the largest city of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, and largest francophone city in the world.Once a site of fishing and trading villages 
situated along the Congo River, Kinshasa is now one of the world's fastest growing megacities.
It faces Brazzaville, the capital of the neighbouring Republic of the Congo; the two cities are the 
world's second-closest pair of capital cities .
The city of Kinshasa is also one of the DRC's 26 provinces.
Because the administrative boundaries of the city-province cover a vast area, over 90 percent of 
the city-province's land is rural in nature, and the urban area occupies a small but expanding 
section on the western side.Kinshasa is Africa's third-largest metropolitan area after Cairo and 
Lagos.
It is also the world's largest Francophone urban area, with French being the language of 
government, education, media, public services and high-end commerce in the city, while Lingala is 
used as a lingua franca in the street.
Kinshasa hosted the 14th Francophonie Summit in October 2012.Residents of Kinshasa are known as 
Kinois  or Kinshasans .
