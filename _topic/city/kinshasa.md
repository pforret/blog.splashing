# Kinshasa

Kinshasa, formerly named LÃ©opoldville before June 30, 1966, is the capital and largest city of the  Democratic Republic of the Congo. Once a site of fishing and trading villages along the Congo River, Kinshasa is now one of the  world's fastest-growing megacities. With an estimated population of 16 million residents, it's the most densely populated city in the  DRC and the most populous city in Africa. It is Africa's third-largest metropolitan area and the leading economic, political, and cultural  center of the DRC. Kinshasa houses several industries, including manufacturing, telecommunications, banking, and  entertainment.
