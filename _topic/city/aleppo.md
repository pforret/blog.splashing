# Aleppo

Aleppo  is a city in Syria, which serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most  populous Governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it is Syria's second-largest city  and also one of the largest cities in the Levant region.Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously  inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that  the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC. That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and  Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and  military importance. Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the  Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia.
