# Aleppo

Aleppo  is a city in Syria, which serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most 
populous Syrian governorate with an official population of 4.6 million in 2010.Aleppo is one of the 
oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth 
millennium BC.
Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that 
the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC.
That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and 
Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and 
military importance.
Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the 
Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia.

For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire's 
third-largest after Constantinople  and Cairo.
