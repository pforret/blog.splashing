Rio de Janeiro, or simply Rio, literally River of January, is the second-most populous city in 
Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas.
Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of the same name, Brazil's third-most populous state, 
after São Paulo and Minas Gerais.
Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named Rio de Janeiro: Carioca 
Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea, on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.Founded in 1565 
by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of 
the Portuguese Empire.
In 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire.
In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court moved to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the seat of the 
court of Queen Maria I of Portugal.
She subsequently, under the leadership of her son the prince regent João VI of Portugal, raised 
Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves.
