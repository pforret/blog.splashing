stratovolcano in the Andes Mountains.

In 2008, the city was designated as the headquarters of the Union of South American Nations.The 
historic center of Quito is one of the largest, least-altered, and best-preserved in the Americas.
Quito and Kraków, Poland, were the first World Cultural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO, in 1978.
The central square of Quito is located about 25 km  south of the equator; the city itself extends 
to within about 1 km  of zero latitude.
