Catania  is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in 
Italy.
It is located on Sicily's east coast, at the base of the active volcano, Mount Etna, and it faces 
the Ionian Sea.
It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is 
the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy.
The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of 
Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidian Greeks.
The city has weathered multiple geologic catastrophes: it was almost completely destroyed by a 
catastrophic earthquake in 1169.
A major eruption and lava flow from nearby Mount Etna nearly swamped the city in 1669 and it 
suffered severe devastation from the 1693 Sicily earthquake.During the 14th century, and into the 
Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political 
centres.
