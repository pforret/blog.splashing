It has important road and rail transport infrastructures, and hosts the main airport in Sicily . The city is located on Sicily's east coast, facing the Ionian Sea at the base of the active volcano  Mount Etna.  It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which  is the seventh-largest metropolitan area in Italy.
