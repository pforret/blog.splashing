# Wuhan

Wuhan  is the capital of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China.
It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of 
over eleven million, the ninth-most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central 
Cities of China.The name Wuhan came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of 
Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the Three Towns of Wuhan .
 Wuhan lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest 
tributary, the Han River, and is known as Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare .Wuhan is considered by some 
to be one of the potential sites of the pivotal Battle of the Red Cliffs, a battle that stopped 
warlord Cao Cao's incursion into southern China at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty.
Other historical events taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led to 
the downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China.
Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang  government 
led by Wang Jingwei.
The city later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during the Second 
Sino-Japanese War.
