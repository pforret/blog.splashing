# London

London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just  under 9 million. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile  estuary down to the  North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium  and retains its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national  government and parliament.  Since the 19th century, the name London has also referred to the metropolis around this core,  historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which  largely comprises Greater London, governed by the Greater London Authority.As one of the world's  major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on its arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce  and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and  communications.
