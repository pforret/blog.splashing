# London

London is the capital and largest city of England, and the United Kingdom, with a population of  around 8.8 million, and the largest city in Western Europe by metropolitan area, with a population  of 14.8 million. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile  estuary down to the  North Sea and has been a major settlement for nearly two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium  and retains its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national  government and parliament. Since the 19th century, the name London also refers to the metropolis around this core,  historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which  since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London, which is governed by 33 local authorities and the  Greater London Authority.As one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong  influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care,  media, science and technology, tourism, transport, and communications.
