# Tokyo

Tokyo, officially the Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of the most populous cities  in the world with a population of over 14 million residents as of 2023. The Tokyo metropolitan area, which includes Tokyo and nearby prefectures, is the world's  most-populous metropolitan area with 40.8 million residents as of 2023, and is the second-largest  metropolitan economy in the world after New York, with a 2022 gross metropolitan product estimated  at US$2.08 trillion .Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kant≈ç region on the  central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the  Emperor of Japan. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards, various commuter  towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands. Despite most of the world knowing Tokyo as a city, since 1943 its governing structure has been more  akin to a prefecture, with an accompanying Governor and Assembly taking precedence over the smaller  municipal governments which make up the metropolis.
