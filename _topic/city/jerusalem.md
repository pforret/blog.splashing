# Jerusalem

Jerusalem  is a city in Western Asia.
Situated on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, it is 
one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy for the three major Abrahamic 
religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
The city straddles the Green Line between Israel and the West Bank; both Israelis and Palestinians 
claim Jerusalem as their capital, as Israel controls the entire city and maintains its primary 
governmental institutions there while the Palestinian National Authority and Palestine Liberation 
Organization ultimately foresee it as the seat of power for the State of Palestine.
Due to this long-running dispute, neither claim is widely recognized internationally.Throughout its 
long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and 
recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times.
The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th 
millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds.
During the Canaanite period, Jerusalem was referred to as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, 
which probably referred to Shalim, a Canaanite deity.
