Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19  municipalities, including the City of Brussels, which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both  the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the Flemish Region   and the Walloon Region.Brussels is the most densely populated region in Belgium, and although it  has the highest GDP per capita, it has the lowest available income per household. The Brussels Region covers 162 km2, a relatively small area compared to the two other regions, and  has a population of over 1.2 million. The five times larger metropolitan area of Brussels comprises over 2.5 million people, which makes  it the largest in Belgium. It is also part of a large conurbation extending towards Ghent, Antwerp, Leuven and Walloon  Brabant, home to over 5 million people.Brussels grew from a small rural settlement on the river  Senne to become an important city-region in Europe.
