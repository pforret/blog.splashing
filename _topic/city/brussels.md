# Brussels

Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19  municipalities, including the City of Brussels, which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both  the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the Flemish Region   and the Walloon Region, located less than 4 kilometres  to the south. Historically Dutch-speaking, Brussels saw a language shift to French from the late 19th century. Nowadays, the Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, although French  is the majority language and lingua franca. Brussels is also increasingly becoming multilingual.
