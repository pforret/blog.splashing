Cairo  is the capital of Egypt and the city-state Cairo Governorate, and is the country's largest  city, home to 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world and the Middle East:  The Greater Cairo metropolitan area  is the 12th-largest in the world by population with a  population of over 22.1 million.Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex  and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are located in its geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, the city first developed as Fustat following the Muslim conquest of  Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods .
