# Cairo

Cairo  is the capital of Egypt and the largest city in the Arab world.
The Greater Cairo metropolitan area, with a population of 21.3 million, is the largest urban 
agglomeration in Africa, the largest in the Arab world and the Middle East, and the sixth-largest 
in the world by population.
Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of 
Memphis and Heliopolis are located in its geographical area.
Located near the Nile Delta, the city first developed as Fustat, a settlement founded after the 
Muslim conquest of Egypt in 640 next to an existing ancient fortress.
Under the Fatimid dynasty a new city, al-QƒÅhirah, was founded nearby in 969.
It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods .
