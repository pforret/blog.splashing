# Cairo

Cairo  is the capital of Egypt and the city-state Cairo Governorate, and is the country's largest  city, home to 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world and the Middle East:  The Greater Cairo metropolitan area, with a population of 21.9 million, is the 12th-largest in the  world by population. Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of  Memphis and Heliopolis are located in its geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, the city first developed as Fustat, a settlement founded after the  Muslim conquest of Egypt in 640 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Under the Fatimid dynasty a new city, al-QƒÅhirah, was founded nearby in 969.
