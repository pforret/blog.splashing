# Vienna

Vienna  is the capital, largest city, and one of nine federal states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's most populous city and its primate city, with about two million inhabitants,  and its cultural, economic, and political center. It is the fifth-largest city proper by population in the European Union and the largest of all  cities on the Danube river by population.  The city lies on the eastern edge of the Vienna Woods —the northeasternmost foothills of the Alps,  that separate Vienna from the more western parts of Austria—at the transition to the Pannonian  Basin.
