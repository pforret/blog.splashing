# Vienna

Vienna  is the national capital, largest city, and one of nine states of Austria.
Vienna is Austria's most populous city, with about 2 million inhabitants, and its cultural, 
economic, and political center.
It is the 6th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, 
and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million 
inhabitants.
Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin.
