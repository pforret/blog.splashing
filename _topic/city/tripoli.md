# Tripoli

Tripoli  is the capital and largest city of Libya, with a population of about 1.1 million people in 
2019.
It is located in the northwest of Libya on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land 
projecting into the Mediterranean Sea and forming a bay.
It includes the port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing center.
It is also the site of the University of Tripoli.
The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate of Muammar Gaddafi, is 
also located in the city.
Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in this barracks.
