rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, and which has a total population of 1,715,600.
While Europeans continue to make up the plurality of Auckland's population, the city became 
multicultural and cosmopolitan in the late-20th century, with Asians accounting for 31% of the 
city's population in 2018.
With its large population of Pasifika New Zealanders, Auckland is also home to the biggest ethnic 
Polynesian population in the world.
The Māori-language name for Auckland is Tāmaki Makaurau, meaning Tāmaki desired by many, in 
reference to the desirability of its natural resources and geography.Auckland lies between the 
Hauraki Gulf to the east, the Hunua Ranges to the south-east, the Manukau Harbour to the 
south-west, and the Waitākere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west.
