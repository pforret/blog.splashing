# Auckland

Auckland   is a large metropolitan city in the North Island of New Zealand. The most populous urban area in the country and the fifth largest city in Oceania, Auckland has an  urban population of about 1,440,300 . It is located in the greater Auckland Region—the area governed by Auckland Council—which includes  outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, and which has a total population of  1,695,200. While Europeans continue to make up the plurality of Auckland's population, the city became  multicultural and cosmopolitan in the late-20th century, with Asians accounting for 31% of the  city's population in 2018. Auckland has the fourth largest foreign-born population in the world, with 39% of its residents  born overseas.
