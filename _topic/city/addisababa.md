Addis Ababa is a highly developed and important cultural, artistic, and financial centre of 
Ethiopia.Addis Ababa was depicted as a fortified place called Barara in the 15th century.
Barara was immediately plundered by Adalite general Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi  following his army 
entrapment in 1529 amidst a war against the Ethiopian medieval army.
Founding history of Addis Ababa dates back in late 19th-century by Menelik II, Negus of Shewa, in 
1886 after finding Mount Entoto unpleasant two years prior.
