# Phnom Penh

Phnom Penh  is the capital and most populous city of Cambodia.
It has been the national capital since the French protectorate of Cambodia, and has grown to become 
the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural centre.

Phnom Penh was founded in 1434 to succeed Angkor Thom as the capital of the Khmer nation but was 
abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by King Norodom.
The city formerly functioned as a processing center, with textiles, pharmaceuticals, machine 
manufacturing, and rice milling.
Its chief assets, however, were cultural.
