# Melbourne

Melbourne  is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the  second-most populous city in both Australia and Oceania. Its name generally refers to a 9,993 km2  metropolitan area known as Greater Melbourne, comprising  an urban agglomeration of 31 local municipalities, although the name is also used specifically for  the local municipality of City of Melbourne based around its central business area. The metropolis occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads  into the Mornington Peninsula, part of West Gippsland, as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra  Valley, the Dandenong and Macedon Ranges. It has a population over 5 million, mostly residing to the east side of the city centre, and its  inhabitants are commonly referred to as Melburnians.The area of Melbourne has been home to  Aboriginal Victorians for over 40,000 years and serves as an important meeting place for local  Kulin nation clans. Of the five peoples of the Kulin nation, the traditional custodians of the land encompassing  Melbourne are the Boonwurrung, Wathaurong and the Wurundjeri peoples.
