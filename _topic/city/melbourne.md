# Melbourne

Melbourne  is the capital of the Australian state of Victoria and the second-most populous city in  Australia, although the most populous by contiguous urban area. Its name generally refers to a 9,993 km2  metropolitan area also known as Greater Melbourne,  comprising an urban agglomeration of 31 local municipalities, although the name is also used  specifically for the local municipality of City of Melbourne based around its central business area.   The metropolis occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads  into the Mornington Peninsula, part of West Gippsland, as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra  Valley, the Dandenong Ranges, and the Macedon Ranges.
