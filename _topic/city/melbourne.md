# Melbourne

Melbourne   is the capital and most-populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the 
second-most populous city in both Australia and Oceania.
 Its name generally refers to a 9,993 km2  metropolitan area known as Greater Melbourne, comprising 
an urban agglomeration of 31 local municipalities, although the name is also used specifically for 
the local municipality of City of Melbourne based around its central business area.
The city occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads into 
the Mornington Peninsula and the hinterlands towards the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong and Macedon 
Ranges.
It has a population over 5 million, mostly residing to the east side of the city centre, and its 
inhabitants are commonly referred to as Melburnians.The area of Melbourne has been home to 
Aboriginal peoples for over 40,000 years and serves as an important meeting place for local Kulin 
nation clans.
The name Naarm is commonly used by the broader Aboriginal community to refer to the city, being the 
traditional Boon wurrung name for Port Phillip Bay.
A short-lived penal settlement was built at Port Phillip, then part of the British colony of New 
South Wales, in 1803, but it was not until 1835, with the arrival of free settlers from Van 
Diemenâ€™s Land, that Melbourne was founded.
