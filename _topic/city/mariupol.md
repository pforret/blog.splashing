# Mariupol

Mariupol  is a city in Ukraine, on the north coast of the Sea of Azov at the mouth of the Kalmius 
river, in the Pryazovia region currently under Russian control.
As of a 2021 census estimate, it was the tenth-largest city in Ukraine and the second-largest in 
Donetsk Oblast, with an estimated population of 431,859.
Mariupol was founded on the site of a former Cossack encampment known as Kalmius, and granted city 
rights in 1778.
Mariupol played a key role in the industrialization of Ukraine, and was a centre for the grain 
trade, metallurgy, and heavy engineering, including the Illich Steel {wikipedia} Iron Works and Azovstal.
Not only was Mariupol a centre for trade and manufacturing, it also played a key role in the 
development of higher education and various other businesses.
From 1948 to 1989, the city was named Zhdanov, after the Soviet functionary Andrei Zhdanov, as part 
of the practice of renaming cities after Communist leaders.In 2014, Mariupol was threatened by 
separatists during the War in Donbas, but was secured by Ukrainian troops.
