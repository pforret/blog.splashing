# Antalya

Antalya  is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey as well as the capital of Antalya Province. It is seen as the capital of tourism in Turkey. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest  Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over 2.6 million people in  its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid  dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon conquered by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as  Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Empire in 1207 and an expanding  Ottoman Empire in 1391.
