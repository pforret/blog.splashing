Sardinia  is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, and one of the 20  regions of Italy. It is located west of the Italian Peninsula, north of Tunisia and immediately south of the French  island of Corsica.  It is one of the five Italian regions with some degree of domestic autonomy being granted by a  special statute. Its official name, Autonomous Region of Sardinia, is bilingual in Italian and Sardinian: Regione  Autonoma della Sardegna / Regione Aut√≤noma de Sardigna.
