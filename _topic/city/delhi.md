# Delhi

Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory  of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of  India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi  shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the  remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres . According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's  population was about 16.8 million.Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities  Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut and YEIDA city in an area known as the  National Capital Region, has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest  metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world .The topography of the medieval fort  Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel  Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in the area have revealed no  signs of an ancient built environment.
