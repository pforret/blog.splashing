# Delhi

Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory  of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of 
India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.
Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or right bank, Delhi shares borders with the 
state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions.
The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres .
According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's 
population was about 16.8 million.
Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon 
and Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region, has an estimated population of over 28 
million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world .The 
topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary 
description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in 
the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment.
From the early 13th-century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, 
the Delhi sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia.
