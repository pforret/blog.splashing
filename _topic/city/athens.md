# Athens

Athens  is a coastal city in the Mediterranean and is both the capital and largest city of Greece. With a population close to four million, it is also the seventh largest city in the European Union. Athens dominates and is the capital of the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities,  with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence beginning  somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and  Aristotle's Lyceum. It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy,  largely because of its cultural and political influence on the European continentâ€”particularly  Ancient Rome.
