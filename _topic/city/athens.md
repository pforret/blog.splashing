# Athens

Athens  is the capital and largest city of Greece.
Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded 
history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 
11th and 7th centuries BC.Classical Athens was a powerful city-state.
It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and 
Aristotle's Lyceum.
It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, 
largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continentâ€”particularly Ancient 
Rome.
In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, 
industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece.
In 2021, Athens' urban area hosted more than three and a half million people, which is around 35% 
of the entire population of Greece.
