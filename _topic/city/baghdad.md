# Baghdad

Baghdad  is the capital of Iraq and the second-largest city in the Arab world after Cairo. It is located on the Tigris near the ruins of the ancient city of Babylon and the Sassanid Persian  capital of Ctesiphon. In 762 CE, Baghdad was chosen as the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, and became its most notable  major development project. Within a short time, the city evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual  center of the Muslim world. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as  well as a multiethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the  Center of Learning.
