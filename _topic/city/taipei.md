# Taipei

Taipei (, officially Taipei City, is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan.
Located in Northern Taiwan, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City that 
sits about 25 km  southwest of the northern port city of Keelung.
Most of the city rests on the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed.
The basin is bounded by the relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join 
to form the Tamsui River along the city's western border.The city of Taipei is home to an estimated 
population of 2,646,204, forming the core part of the Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area, which 
includes the nearby cities of New Taipei and Keelung with a population of 7,047,559, the 40th 
most-populous urban area in the world—roughly one-third of Taiwanese citizens live in the metro 
district.
The name Taipei can refer either to the whole metropolitan area or just the city itself.
