# Destination: Ardennes

The Ardennes, also known as the Ardennes Forest or Forest of Ardennes, is a region of extensive 
forests, rough terrain, rolling hills and ridges primarily in Belgium and Luxembourg, extending 
into Germany and France.
Geologically, the range is a western extension of the Eifel; both were raised during the Givetian 
age of the Devonian, as were several other named ranges of the same greater range.The Ardennes 
proper stretches well into Germany and France  and geologically into the Eifel ; most of it is in 
the southeast of Wallonia, the southern and more rural part of Belgium .
The eastern part of the Ardennes forms the northernmost third of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, 
also called Oesling .
On the southeast the Eifel region continues into the German state of the Rhineland-Palatinate.
