# Destination: Costa Brava

The Costa Brava  is a coastal region of Catalonia in northeastern Spain, consisting of the 
comarques  of Alt Empordà, Baix Empordà and Selva in the province of Girona.
Costa Brava stretches from the town of Blanes, 60 km  northeast of Barcelona, to the French border.

In the 1950s, the Costa Brava was identified by the Spanish government and local entrepreneurs as 
being suitable for substantial development as a holiday destination, mainly for package holiday 
tourists from Europe.
The combination of a very good summer climate, nature, excellent beaches and a favourable foreign 
exchange rate, which made Costa Brava an attractive tourist destination, was exploited by the 
construction of large numbers of hotels and apartments in such seaside resorts as Blanes, Tossa de 
Mar and Lloret de Mar.
