# Destination: Costa Brava

The Costa Brava  is a coastal region of Catalonia in northeastern Spain. Sources differ on the exact definition of the Costa Brava. Usually it can be regarded as stretching from the town of Blanes, 60 km  northeast of Barcelona, to  the French border â€“ in other words it consists of the coast of the province of Girona.  In the 1950s, the Costa Brava was identified by the Spanish government and local entrepreneurs as  being suitable for substantial development as a holiday destination, mainly for package holiday  tourists from Europe.
