# Destination: Salerno

Salerno  is an ancient city and comune in Campania  and is the capital of the namesake province,  being the second largest city in the region by number of inhabitants, after Naples. It is located on the Gulf of Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea. In recent history the city hosted Victor Emmanuel III, the King of Italy, who moved from Rome in  1943 after Italy negotiated a peace with the Allies in World War II, making Salerno the capital of  the Government of the South  and therefore provisional government seat for six months. Some of the Allied landings during Operation Avalanche  occurred near Salerno.
