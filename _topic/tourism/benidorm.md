# Destination: Benidorm

Benidorm is a town and municipality in the province of Alicante, Valencia, on the Mediterranean  coast of Spain.  Benidorm has been a tourist destination within Spain since 1925, when its port was extended and the  first hotels were built, though it would not be until the 1950s that it became renowned as a summer  destination for people coming from inland Spain, especially Madrid. Today it is known for its hotel industry, beaches, and skyscrapers and receives as many tourists  from abroad as from Spain. According to the 2020 census, Benidorm has a permanent population of 70,451 inhabitants, making it  the fifth-most populous town in the Alicante province and the ninth in Valencian Community.
