# Destination: San Marco

San Marco is one of the six sestieri of Venice, lying in the heart of the city as the main place of 
Venice.
 San Marco also includes the island of San Giorgio Maggiore.
 Although the district includes Saint Mark's Square, that was never administered as part of the 
sestiere.
