# Destination: Angkor Wat

Angkor Wat  is a temple complex in Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world, on  a site measuring 162.6 hectares . Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire by King  Suryavarman II during the 12th century, it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards  the end of the century; as such, it is also described as a Hindu-Buddhist temple.Angkor Wat was  built at the behest of the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Ya≈õodharapura,  the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later  galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology: within a moat more  than 5 kilometres  long and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres  long are three rectangular galleries,  each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers.
