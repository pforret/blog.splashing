# Destination: Angkor Wat

Angkor Wat  is a temple complex in Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world, on 
a site measuring 162.6 hectares .
Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, it was 
gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century as such it is also 
described as a Hindu-Buddhist temple.It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 
12th century in Ya≈õodharapura, the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual 
mausoleum.
Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu.
As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant 
religious centre since its foundation.
The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture.
