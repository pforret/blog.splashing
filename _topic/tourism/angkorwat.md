# Destination: Angkor Wat

Angkor Wat  is a Hindu-Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia, located on a site measuring 162.6  hectares . It resides within the ancient Khmer capital city of Angkor. The Guinness World Records considers it as the largest religious structure in the world. Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire by King  Suryavarman II during the 12th century, it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards  the end of the century; as such, it is also described as a Hindu-Buddhist temple.Angkor Wat was  built at the behest of the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Ya≈õodharapura,  the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later  galleried temple.
