# Destination: Taj Mahal

The Taj Mahal, is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna  in the 
Indian city of Agra.
It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan  to house the tomb of his favourite 
wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare  complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, 
and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases 
of the project for another 10 years.
