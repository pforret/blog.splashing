# Destination: Lesbos

Lesbos or Lesvos  is a Greek island located in the northeastern Aegean Sea, often called Mytilene  
in Greece, after its capital.
It has an area of 1,633 km2  with 321 kilometres  of coastline, making it the third largest island 
in Greece.
It is separated from Turkey by the narrow Mytilini Strait and in late Palaeolithic/Mesolithic times 
was joined to the Anatolian mainland before the end of the Last Glacial Period.

Lesbos is also the name of a regional unit of the North Aegean region, within which Lesbos island 
is one of five governing islands.
