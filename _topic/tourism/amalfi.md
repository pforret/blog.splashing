# Destination: Amalfi

Amalfi  is a town and comune in the province of Salerno, in the region of Campania, Italy, on the  Gulf of Salerno. It lies at the mouth of a deep ravine, at the foot of Monte Cerreto, surrounded by dramatic cliffs  and coastal scenery. The town of Amalfi was the capital of the maritime republic known as the Duchy of Amalfi, an  important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200.  In the 1920s and 1930s, Amalfi was a popular holiday destination for the British upper class and  aristocracy.
