# cookie

A cookie  or biscuit  is a baked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat, and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, or nuts.  Most English-speaking countries call crunchy cookies biscuits, except for the United States and  Canada, where biscuit refers to a type of quick bread.
