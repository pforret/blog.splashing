# pretzel

A pretzel (, from German pronunciation, standard German: Breze ( is a type of baked pastry made  from dough that is commonly shaped into a knot. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive symmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of  dough intertwined and then twisted back onto itself in a particular way . Today, pretzels come in a wide range of shapes.  Salt is the most common seasoning, or topping, for pretzels, complementing the washing soda or lye  treatment that gives pretzels their traditional skin and flavor acquired through the Maillard  reaction.
