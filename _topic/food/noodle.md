# noodle

Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is either rolled flat and cut,  stretched, or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures  and made into a variety of shapes.  While long, thin strips may be the most common, many varieties of noodles are cut into waves,  helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded over, or cut into other shapes. Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added.
