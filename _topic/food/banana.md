# banana

A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large  herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains, distinguishing them from  dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft  flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when  ripe. The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless  bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa  balbisiana.
