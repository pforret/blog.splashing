# pasta

Pasta  is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or  eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Unlike noodles, pasta was traditionally only made with durum, although the definition has been  expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet such as rice flour, or legumes such as  beans or lentils. While noodles are believed to have originated in Asia, pasta is believed to have originated in  Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine.Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried   and fresh . Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at  home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.
