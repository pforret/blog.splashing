# bread

Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour  and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important part of many cultures'  diet. It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance since the dawn of  agriculture, and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.  Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or  high-pressure aeration, which creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread.
