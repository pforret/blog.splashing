Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of  preparations that can be simple or elaborate and which share features with desserts such as  pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.  The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such  as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts  such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients.
