# almond

The almond  is a species of small tree from the genus Prunus, cultivated worldwide for its seed, a  culinary nut. Along with the peach, it is classified in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other  subgenera by corrugations on the shell  surrounding the seed.The fruit of the almond is a drupe,  consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat,  which is then removed to reveal the white embryo.
