# cabbage

Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red, or white   biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage, and belongs to the cole crops or brassicas, meaning it is  closely related to broccoli and cauliflower ; Brussels sprouts ; and Savoy cabbage .  A cabbage generally weighs between 500 and 1,000 grams . Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages  and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer.
