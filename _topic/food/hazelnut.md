# hazelnut

The hazelnut is the fruit of the hazel tree and therefore includes any of the nuts deriving from  species of the genus Corylus, especially the nuts of the species Corylus avellana. They are also known as cobnuts or filberts according to species.  Hazelnuts are used as a snack food, in baking and desserts, and in breakfast cereals such as muesli. In confectionery, they are used to make praline, and also used in combination with chocolate for  chocolate truffles and products such as chocolate bars and hazelnut cocoa spreads such as Nutella.
