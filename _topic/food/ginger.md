# ginger

Ginger  is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root or ginger, is widely used as a spice and a  folk medicine. It is a herbaceous perennial which grows annual pseudostems  about one meter tall, bearing narrow  leaf blades. The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals with purple edges, and arise directly  from the rhizome on separate shoots.Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes  turmeric, cardamom, and galangal. Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian  peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion,  reaching as far as Hawaii.
