# cream

Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before  homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called  separators. In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated  fat.Cream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from cream skimmed from  whey, a by-product of cheese-making.
