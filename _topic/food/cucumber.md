The cucumber  is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the family Cucurbitaceae that bears  cylindrical to spherical fruits, which are used as culinary vegetables. Considered an annual plant, there are three main types of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and  seedless—within which several cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates in Asia extending from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, China, and Northern  Thailand, but now grows on most continents, and many different types of cucumber are grown  commercially and traded on the global market. In North America, the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah,  though the two are not closely related.
