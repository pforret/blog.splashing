An onion, also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely  cultivated species of the genus Allium. The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until  2011.: 21  Its close relatives include garlic, scallion, leek, and chive.This genus also contains  several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese  bunching onion Allium fistulosum, the tree onion Allium × proliferum, and the Canada onion Allium  canadense. The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species, but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become  established in some regions.
