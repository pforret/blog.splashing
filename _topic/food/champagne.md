Champagne  is a sparkling wine originated and produced in the Champagne wine region of France under  the rules of the appellation, which demand specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes  exclusively from designated places within it, specific grape-pressing methods and secondary  fermentation of the wine in the bottle to cause carbonation.  The grapes Pinot noir, Pinot meunier, and Chardonnay are used to produce almost all Champagne, but  small amounts of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Arbane, and Petit Meslier are vinified as well.
