The chicken  is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of  Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for  cockfighting.   Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of  2018, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds.
