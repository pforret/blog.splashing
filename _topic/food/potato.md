# potato

The potato  is a starchy root vegetable native to the Americas that is consumed as a staple food in  many parts of the world. Potatoes are tubers of the plant Solanum tuberosum, a perennial in the nightshade family  Solanaceae.Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans independently in  multiple locations, but later genetic studies traced a single origin, in the area of present-day  southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000â€“10,000 years ago from a species in the S. brevicaule complex.
