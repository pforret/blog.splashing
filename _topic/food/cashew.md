# cashew

Cashew is the common name of a tropical evergreen tree Anacardium occidentale, in the family  Anacardiaceae. It is native to South America  and is the source of the cashew nut and the cashew apple, an  accessory fruit. The tree can grow as tall as 14 metres, but the dwarf cultivars, growing up to 6 m, prove more  profitable, with earlier maturity and greater yields. The cashew nut is edible and is eaten on its own as a snack, used in recipes, or processed into  cashew cheese or cashew butter.  The nut is often simply called a 'cashew'.
