# carrot

The carrot  is a root vegetable, typically orange in color, though heirloom variants including  purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist, all of which are domesticated forms of the  wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also  eaten. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured  taproot.
