# soup

Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot, that is made by combining  ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the  flavors are extracted, forming a broth. Soups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two;  however, soups generally have more liquid  than stews.In traditional French cuisine, soups are  classified into two main groups: clear soups and thick soups. The established French classifications of clear soups are bouillon and consommé. Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used: purées are vegetable  soups thickened with starch; bisques are made from puréed shellfish or vegetables thickened with  cream; cream soups may be thickened with béchamel sauce; and veloutés are thickened with eggs,  butter, and cream.
