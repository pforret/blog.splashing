# cinnamon

Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several tree species from the genus Cinnamomum. Cinnamon is used mainly as an aromatic condiment and flavouring additive in a wide variety of  cuisines, sweet and savoury dishes, breakfast cereals, snack foods, bagels, teas, hot chocolate and  traditional foods. The aroma and flavour of cinnamon derive from its essential oil and principal component,  cinnamaldehyde, as well as numerous other constituents including eugenol.
