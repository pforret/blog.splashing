Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily  due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits  are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before  being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
