# peanut

The peanut, also known as the groundnut, goober, pindar  or monkey nut, is a legume crop grown  mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, important to both small and large commercial  producers. It is classified as both a grain legume and, due to its high oil content, an oil crop. World annual production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016, led by China with 38% of  the world total. Atypically among legume crop plants, peanut pods develop underground  rather than above ground.
