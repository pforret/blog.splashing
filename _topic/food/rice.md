# rice

Rice is a cereal grain, and in its domesticated form is the staple food for over half of the  world's human population, particularly in Asia and Africa, due to the vast amount of soil that is  able to grow rice. Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa  or, much less commonly, O. glaberrima . Asian rice was domesticated in China some 13,500 to 8,200 years ago, while African rice was  domesticated in Africa some 3,000 years ago. Rice has become commonplace in many cultures worldwide; in 2021, 787 million tons were produced,  placing it fourth after sugarcane, maize, and wheat.
