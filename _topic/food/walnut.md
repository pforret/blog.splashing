# walnut

A walnut is the edible seed of any tree of the genus Juglans, particularly the Persian or English  walnut, Juglans regia. They are accessory fruit because the outer covering of the fruit is technically an involucre and  thus not morphologically part of the carpel; this means it cannot be a drupe but is instead a  drupe-like nut.  After full ripening, the shell is discarded, and the kernel is eaten. Nuts of the eastern black walnut  and butternuts  are less commonly consumed.
