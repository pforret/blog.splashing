# bacon

Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically the belly or less fatty parts  of the back. It is eaten as a side dish, used as a central ingredient, or as a flavouring or accent.  Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant,  and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat. The word is derived from the Proto-Germanic *bakkon, meaning back meat.
