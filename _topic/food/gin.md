# gin

Gin ( is a distilled alcoholic drink flavoured with juniper berries and other botanical  ingredients.Gin originated as a medicinal liquor made by monks and alchemists across Europe. The modern gin was modified in Flanders and the Netherlands to provide aqua vita from distillates  of grapes and grains, becoming an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin became popular in England after the introduction of jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor. Although this development had been taking place since the early 17th century, gin became widespread  after the 1688 Glorious Revolution led by William of Orange and subsequent import restrictions on  French brandy. Gin emerged as the national alcoholic drink of England during the so-called Gin Craze of 1695â€“1735.
