# steak

A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a  bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into  patties, such as hamburgers.  Steaks are cut from animals including cattle, bison, buffalo, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep,  ostrich, pigs, turkey, and deer, as well as various types of fish, especially salmon and large fish  such as swordfish, shark, and marlin.
