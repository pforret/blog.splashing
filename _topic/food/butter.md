# butter

Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of churned cream. It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature, consisting of approximately 80% butterfat. It is used at room temperature as a spread, melted as a condiment, and used as a fat in baking,  sauce-making, pan frying, and other cooking procedures.  Most frequently made from cow's milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other  mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks.
