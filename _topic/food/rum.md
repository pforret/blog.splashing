# rum

Rum is a liquor made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice. The distillate, a clear liquid, is often aged in barrels of oak. While associated with the Caribbean due to its Barbadian origin, rum is nowadays produced in nearly  every major sugar-producing region of the world, such as the Philippines, where Tanduay Distillers,  the largest producer of rum worldwide, has its headquarters.Rums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas golden and dark rums were typically consumed  straight or neat, iced, or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are made to be consumed either straight or iced.
