# popcorn

Popcorn  is a variety of corn kernel which expands and puffs up when heated; the same names also  refer to the foodstuff produced by the expansion.  A popcorn kernel's strong hull contains the seed's hard, starchy shell endosperm with 14â€“20%  moisture, which turns to steam as the kernel is heated. Pressure from the steam continues to build until the hull ruptures, allowing the kernel to  forcefully expand, to 20 to 50 times its original size, and then cool.Some strains of corn  are  cultivated specifically as popping corns. The Zea mays variety everta, a special kind of flint corn, is the most common of these.
