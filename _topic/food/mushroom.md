# mushroom

A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced  above ground, on soil, or on its food source. Toadstool generally denotes one poisonous to humans.The standard for the name mushroom is the  cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence, the word mushroom is most often applied  to those fungi  that have a stem, a cap, and gills  on the underside of the cap. Mushroom also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term  is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant  surface.
