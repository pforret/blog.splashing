# milkshake

A milkshake  is a sweet beverage made by blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners  such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, or fruit syrup into a thick, sweet, cold  mixture. It may also be made using a base made from non-dairy products, including plant milks such as almond  milk, coconut milk, or soy milk. Dry ingredients such as whole fruit, nuts, seeds, candy, or cookies may be incorporated.  Milkshakes originated in the United States around the turn of the 20th century, and grew in  popularity following the introduction of electric blenders in the subsequent two decades.
