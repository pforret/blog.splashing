# brandy

Brandy is a liquor produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35â€“60% alcohol by volume  and is typically consumed as an after-dinner  digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks. Others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of ageing, and some are produced  using a combination of ageing and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world.
