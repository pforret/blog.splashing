# tea

Tea, or cha, is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh  leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in  the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar. Tea is also made, but rarely, from the leaves of Camellia taliensis. After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent  flavour, while others have profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.An early credible  record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese  physician Hua Tuo.
