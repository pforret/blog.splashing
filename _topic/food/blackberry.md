# blackberry

The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family  Rosaceae, hybrids among these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera  Rubus and Idaeobatus. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis,  so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates. For example, the entire subgenus Rubus has been called the Rubus fruticosus aggregate, although the  species R. fruticosus is considered a synonym of R. plicatus.Rubus armeniacus  is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the  Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and  suburban parks and woodlands.
