# sandwich

A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or  between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper  for another food type. The sandwich began as a portable, convenient finger food in the Western world, though over time it  has become prevalent worldwide.  In the 21st century there has been considerable debate over the precise definition of sandwich, and  specifically whether a hot dog or open sandwich can be categorized as such. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are the  responsible agencies.
