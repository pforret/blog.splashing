A sausage is a type of meat product usually made from ground meat—often pork, beef, or  poultry—along with salt, spices and other flavourings. Other ingredients, such as grains or breadcrumbs may be included as fillers or extenders.  When used as an uncountable noun, the word sausage can refer to the loose sausage meat, which can  be formed into patties or stuffed into a skin. When referred to as a sausage, the product is usually cylindrical and encased in a skin.
