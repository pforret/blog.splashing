# grape

A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus  Vitis. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.  The cultivation of grapes began perhaps 8,000 years ago, and the fruit has been used as human food  over history. Eaten fresh or in dried form, grapes also hold cultural significance in many parts of the world,  particularly for their role in winemaking.
