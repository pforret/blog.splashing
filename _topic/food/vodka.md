# vodka

Vodka  is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage. Different varieties originated in Poland, Russia, and Sweden. Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol but sometimes with traces of impurities and  flavourings. Traditionally, it is made by distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains,  and potatoes since  introduced in Europe in the 1700s. Some modern brands use corn, sugar cane, fruits, honey, and maple sap  as the base.
