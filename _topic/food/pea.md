# pea

Pea  is a pulse, vegetable or fodder crop, but the word often refers to the seed or sometimes the  pod of this flowering plant species, formerly 'Pisum sativum', it has been proposed to rename the  species as Lathyrus oleraceus based on the work of Schaefer et al. . Each pod contains several seeds, which can have green or yellow cotyledons when mature. Botanically, pea pods are fruit, since they contain seeds and develop from the ovary of a  flower. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea, the  cowpea, the seeds from several species of Lathyrus and is used as a compound form for example  Sturt's desert pea.
