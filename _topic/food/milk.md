# milk

Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals  before they are able to digest solid food. Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune  system and thus reduce the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.As an agricultural product, dairy milk  is collected from farm animals.
