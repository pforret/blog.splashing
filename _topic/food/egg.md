# egg

An egg is an organic vessel grown by an animal to carry a possibly fertilized egg cell  and to  incubate from it an embryo within the egg until the embryo has become an animal fetus that can  survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches.  Most arthropods, vertebrates, and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not.
