# wine

Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented fruit. Yeast consumes the sugar in the fruits and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing  heat in the process. Though wine can be made from a variety of fruit crops such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry,  currant and elderberry, it is most often made from grapes, and the term wine generally refers to  grape wine when used without a qualifier.
