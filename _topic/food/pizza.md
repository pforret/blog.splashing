Pizza  is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based  dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a  high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.The term pizza was first recorded in the year  997, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with  Campania. Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating modern pizza in Naples. In 2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality  guaranteed dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural  heritage.Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias, Mediterranean restaurants, via  delivery, and as street food.
