# conga

The conga, also known as  tumbadora, is a tall, narrow, single-headed drum from Cuba.
Congas are staved like barrels and classified into three types: quinto, tres dos or tres golpes, 
and tumba or salidor .
Congas were originally used in Afro-Cuban music genres such as conga  and rumba, where each drummer 
would play a single drum.
Following numerous innovations in conga drumming and construction during the mid-20th century, as 
well as its internationalization, it became increasingly common for drummers to play two or three 
drums.
Congas have become a popular instrument in many forms of Latin music such as son, descarga, 
Afro-Cuban jazz, salsa, songo, merengue and Latin rock.
