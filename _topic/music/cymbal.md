# cymbal

A cymbal is a common percussion instrument.
Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys.
The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on 
ancient designs sound a definite note .
Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, 
heavy metal bands, and marching groups.
Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride, or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals.
