# xylophone

The xylophone  is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck 
by mallets.
Like the glockenspiel, the xylophone essentially consists of a set of tuned keys arranged in the 
fashion of the keyboard of a piano.
Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in 
the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's instruments, or 
chromatic for orchestral use.

The term xylophone may be used generally, to include all such instruments such as the marimba, 
balafon and even the semantron.
