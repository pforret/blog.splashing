A gong is a percussion instrument originating in East Asia and Southeast Asia. Gongs are a flat, circular metal disc that is typically struck with a mallet. They can be small or large in size, and tuned or can require tuning.  The earliest possible depictions of gongs is from the details on the surface of the Ngọc Lũ I  bronze drum  from the Dong Son culture of northern Vietnam.
