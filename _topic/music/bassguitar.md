# bass guitar

The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass (, is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or acoustic  guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.  The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one  octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar .
