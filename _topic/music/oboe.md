# oboe

The oboe  is a type of double reed woodwind instrument.
Oboes are usually made of wood, but may also be made of synthetic materials, such as plastic, 
resin, or hybrid composites.
The most common oboe plays in the treble or soprano range.

A soprano oboe measures roughly 65 cm  long, with metal keys, a conical bore and a flared bell.
