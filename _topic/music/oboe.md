# oboe

The oboe  is a type of double reed woodwind instrument. Oboes are usually made of wood, but may also be made of synthetic materials, such as plastic,  resin, or hybrid composites. The most common oboe plays in C using the treble clef, but other members of the oboe family play in  different keys such as the English Horn which is in the key of F. All oboes in the oboe family read in treble clef regardless of range to allow oboists to read on  all oboe family instruments effectively.
