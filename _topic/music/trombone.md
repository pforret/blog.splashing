# trombone

The trombone  is a musical instrument in the brass family.
As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips  cause the air 
column inside the instrument to vibrate.
Most brass instruments use valves to alter the pitch, but trombones have a telescoping slide 
mechanism instead.
Many modern trombone models also have a valve attachment which lowers the pitch of the instrument.
Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.
