# tuba

The tuba  is the largest and lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, the sound is produced by lip vibration – a buzz – into a mouthpiece. It first appeared in the mid-19th century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern  orchestra and concert band, and largely replaced the ophicleide. Tuba is Latin for trumpet.A person who plays the tuba is called a tubaist, a tubist, or simply a  tuba player. In a British brass band or military band, they are known as bass players.
