# Epiphone

Epiphone is an American musical instrument brand that traces its roots to a musical instrument 
manufacturing business founded in 1873 by Anastasios Stathopoulos in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire and 
moved to New York City in 1908.
 After taking over his father's business, Epaminondas Stathopoulos named the company Epiphone as a 
combination of his own nickname Epi and the suffix -phone  in 1928, the same year it began making 
guitars.

In 1957, Epiphone, Inc.
was purchased by Gibson, its main rival in the archtop guitar market at the time.
