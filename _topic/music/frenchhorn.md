# french horn

The French horn  is a brass instrument made of tubing wrapped into a coil with a flared bell.
The double horn in F/Bâ™­  is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and 
bands, although the descant and triple horn have become increasingly popular.
A musician who plays a horn is known as a horn player or hornist.

Pitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors: speed of air through the 
instrument ; diameter and tension of lip aperture  in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern horn, the 
operation of valves by the left hand, which route the air into extra sections of tubing.
