# marimba

The marimba ( is a percussion instrument consisting of a set of wooden bars struck with 
yarn-wrapped or rubber mallets to produce musical tones.
Resonators or pipes are suspended underneath the bars to amplify the sound of the wooden bars.
 The bars of a chromatic marimba are arranged like the keys of a piano, with the groups of two and 
three accidentals raised vertically, overlapping the natural bars to aid the performer both 
visually and physically.
This instrument is a type of idiophone, but with a more resonant and lower-pitched tessitura than 
the xylophone.
