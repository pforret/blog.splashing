# cassette tape

The Compact Cassette or Musicassette, also commonly called the tape cassette, cassette tape, audio  cassette, or simply tape or cassette, is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio  recording and playback. Invented by Lou Ottens and his team at the Dutch company Philips in 1963, Compact Cassettes come in  two forms, either already containing content as a prerecorded cassette, or as a fully recordable  blank cassette. Both forms have two sides and are reversible by the user. Although other tape cassette formats have also existed - for example the Microcassette - the  generic term cassette tape is normally always used to refer to the Compact Cassette because of its  ubiquity.Its uses have ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early  microcomputers; the Compact Cassette technology was originally designed for dictation machines, but  improvements in fidelity led to it supplanting the stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape  recording in most non-professional audio applications by the mid-1970s.  It became an extremely popular format for prerecorded music, first alongside the LP record and  later the digital compact disc ; the latter format eventually caused prerecorded cassettes to fade  into obscurity by the mid-1990s in many countries, but it continued to be popular well into the  2000s in some other countries as well as for home recording purposes.
