# cassette tape

The Compact Cassette or Musicassette, also commonly called the tape cassette, cassette tape, audio 
cassette, or simply tape or cassette, is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio 
recording and playback.
It was developed by the Dutch company Philips in Hasselt, Belgium, by Lou Ottens and his team.
It was introduced in September 1963.
Compact Cassettes come in two forms, either already containing content as a prerecorded cassette, 
or as a fully recordable blank cassette.
Both forms have two sides and are reversible by the user.The compact cassette technology was 
originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette 
to supplant the stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional 
applications.
