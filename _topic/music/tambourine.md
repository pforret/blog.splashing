# tambourine

The tambourine is a musical instrument in the percussion family consisting of a frame, often of  wood or plastic, with pairs of small metal jingles, called zills. Classically the term tambourine denotes an instrument with a drumhead, though some variants may not  have a head. Tambourines are often used with regular percussion sets. They can be mounted, for example on a stand as part of a drum kit, or they can be held in the hand  and played by tapping, hitting, or shaking the instrument.
