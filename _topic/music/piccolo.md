# piccolo

The piccolo  is a half-size flute and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. Sometimes referred to as a baby flute or piccolo flute, the modern piccolo has the same type of  fingerings as the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher. This has given rise to the name ottavino, by which the instrument is called in Italian and thus  also in scores of Italian composers.
