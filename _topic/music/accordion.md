Accordions  are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed 
aerophone type, colloquially referred to as a squeezebox.
A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist.
 The concertina and bandone√≥n are related.
The harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family, but are typically larger than an 
accordion and sit on a surface or the floor.
