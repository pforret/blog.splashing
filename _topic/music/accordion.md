Accordions  are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free reed  aerophone type . The essential characteristic of the accordion is to combine in one instrument a melody section,  also called the diskant, usually on the right-hand keyboard, with an accompaniment or Basso  continuo functionality on the left-hand. The musician normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand side, and the  accompaniment on bass or pre-set chord buttons on the left-hand side. A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist.
