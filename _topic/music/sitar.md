# sitar

The sitar  is a plucked stringed instrument, originating from the Indian subcontinent, used in 
Hindustani classical music.
The instrument was invented in medieval India, flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries, and 
arrived at its present form in 18th-century India.

Used widely throughout the Indian subcontinent, the sitar became popularly known in the wider world 
through the works of Ravi Shankar, beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
In the 1960s, a short-lived trend arose for the use of the sitar in Western popular music, with the 
instrument appearing on tracks by bands such as the Beatles, the Doors, the Rolling Stones and 
others.
