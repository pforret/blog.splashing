# electric guitar

An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical  performance volumes, unlike a standard acoustic guitar. It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which  ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.  The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal  qualities from that of an acoustic guitar via amplifier settings or knobs on the guitar. Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion and overdrive; the latter  is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and jazz and rock guitar playing. Designs also exist combining attributes of the electric and acoustic guitars: the semi-acoustic and  acoustic-electric guitars.
