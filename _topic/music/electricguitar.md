# electric guitar

An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical 
performance volumes, unlike a standard acoustic guitar .
It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which 
ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.
 The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal 
qualities on the amplifier settings or the knobs on the guitar from that of an acoustic guitar.
Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion and overdrive; the latter 
is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and rock guitar playing.
