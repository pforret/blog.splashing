# clarinet

The clarinet is a single-reed musical instrument in the woodwind family, with a nearly cylindrical  bore and a flared bell.  Clarinets comprise a family of instruments of differing sizes and pitches. The clarinet family is the largest woodwind family, ranging from the BB♭ contrabass to the E♭  soprano. The B♭ soprano clarinet is the most common type, and is the instrument usually indicated by the  word clarinet.
