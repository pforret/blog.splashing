# clarinet

The clarinet is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument.
Like many wind instruments, clarinets are made in several different sizes, each having its own 
range of pitches.
All have a nearly-cylindrical bore and a flared bell, and utilize a mouthpiece with a single reed.
A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist .
