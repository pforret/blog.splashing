The ocarina  is a wind musical instrument; it is a type of vessel flute. Variations exist, but a typical ocarina is an enclosed space with four to twelve finger holes and a  mouthpiece that projects from the body. It is traditionally made from clay or ceramic, but other materials are also used, such as plastic,  wood, glass, metal, or bone.
