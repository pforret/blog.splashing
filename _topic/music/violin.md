# violin

The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone  in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument  in the family in regular use. The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5,  and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers  and, in specialized cases, by  striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow .
