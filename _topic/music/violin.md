# violin

The violin, colloquially known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone, and is the smallest, and thus  highest-pitched instrument  in regular use in the violin family. Smaller violin-type instruments exist, including the violino piccolo and the pochette, but these  are virtually unused. Most violins have a hollow wooden body, and commonly have four strings, usually tuned in perfect  fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and are most commonly played by drawing a bow across the strings. The violin can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers  and, in specialized cases,  by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow .
