# fiddle

A fiddle is a bowed string musical instrument, most often a violin.
It is a colloquial term for the violin, used by players in all genres, including classical music.
Although in many cases violins and fiddles are essentially synonymous, the style of the music 
played may determine specific construction differences between fiddles and classical violins.
For example, fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to reduce the range 
of bow-arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle, a form of bariolage involving 
rapid alternation between pairs of adjacent strings.
To produce a brighter tone, compared to the deeper tones of gut or synthetic core strings, fiddlers 
often use steel strings.
