# banjo

The banjo is a stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity to form a 
resonator.
The membrane is typically circular, and usually made of plastic, or occasionally animal skin.
Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by African Americans in the United States.
The banjo is frequently associated with folk and country music, and has also been used in some 
rock, pop and hip-hop.
Several rock bands, such as the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, and The Allman Brothers, have used the 
five-string banjo in some of their songs.
