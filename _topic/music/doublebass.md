# double bass

The double bass (, also known simply as the bass (, is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed  string  instrument in the modern symphony orchestra . Similar in structure to the cello, it has four, although occasionally five, strings.  The bass is a standard member of the orchestra's string section, along with violins, viola, and  cello,  as well as the concert band, and is featured in concertos, solo, and chamber music in  Western classical music. The bass is used in a range of other genres, such as jazz, 1950s-style blues, rock and roll,  rockabilly, psychobilly, traditional country music, bluegrass, tango and folk music.
