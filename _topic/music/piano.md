The piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when the keys are pressed. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys: 52 white keys for the notes of the C  major scale  and 36 shorter black keys raised above the white keys and set further back, for sharps  and flats. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches, spanning a range of a bit over seven  octaves. The black keys are for the accidentals, which are needed to play in all twelve keys.
