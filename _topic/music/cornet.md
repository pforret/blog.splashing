# cornet

The cornet  is a brass instrument similar to the trumpet but distinguished from it by its conical 
bore, more compact shape, and mellower tone quality.
 The most common cornet is a transposing instrument in B♭, though there is also a soprano cornet in 
E♭ and cornets in A and C.
All are unrelated to the Renaissance and early Baroque cornett.
