# mandolin

A mandolin  is a stringed musical instrument in the lute family and is generally plucked with a  pick. It most commonly has four courses of doubled strings tuned in unison, thus giving a total of eight  strings. A variety of string types are used, with steel strings being the most common and usually the least  expensive. The courses are typically tuned in an interval of perfect fifths, with the same tuning as a violin . Also, like the violin, it is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave  mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.
