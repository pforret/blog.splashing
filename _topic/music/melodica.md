# melodica

The melodica is a free-reed instrument similar to the pump organ and harmonica.
It has a musical keyboard on top, and is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece that fits into 
a hole in the side of the instrument.
Pressing a key opens a hole, allowing air to flow through a reed.
The keyboard usually covers two or three octaves.
Melodicas are small, light, and portable.
