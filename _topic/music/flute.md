The flute is a family of classical music instrument in the woodwind group. Like all woodwinds, flutes are aerophones, meaning they make sound by vibrating a column of air. However, unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is a reedless wind instrument that  produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized as  edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or flutist.
