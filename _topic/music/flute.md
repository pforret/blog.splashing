# flute

The flute is a member of a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Like all woodwinds, flutes are aerophones, producing sound with a vibrating column of air. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute produces sound when the player's air flows across  an opening. In the Hornbostelâ€“Sachs classification system, flutes are edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or flutist.
