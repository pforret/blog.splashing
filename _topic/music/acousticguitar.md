# acoustic guitar

An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the string family. When a string is plucked, its vibration is transmitted from the bridge, resonating throughout the  top of the guitar. It is also transmitted to the side and back of the instrument, resonating through the air in the  body, and producing sound from the sound hole. While the original, general term for this stringed instrument is guitar, the retronym 'acoustic  guitar' – often used to indicate the steel stringed model – distinguishes it from an electric  guitar, which relies on electronic amplification. Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box, of which the top side serves as a sound board that  enhances the vibration sounds of the strings.
