# Sport: badminton

Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are singles  and  doubles . Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are  played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other  team's half of the court.
