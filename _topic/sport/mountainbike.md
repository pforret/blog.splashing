# Sport: mountain bike

A mountain bike  or mountain bicycle is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling.
Mountain bikes share some similarities with other bicycles, but incorporate features designed to 
enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, which makes them heavier, more complex and 
less efficient on smooth surfaces.
These typically include a suspension fork, large knobby tires, more durable wheels, more powerful 
brakes, straight, extra wide handlebars to improve balance and comfort over rough terrain, and 
wide-ratio gearing optimised for topography and application .
Rear suspension is ubiquitous in heavier-duty bikes and now common even in lighter bikes.
Dropper posts can be installed to allow the rider to quickly adjust the seat height .
