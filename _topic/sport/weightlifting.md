# Sport: weightlifting

Weightlifting generally refers to activities in which people lift weights, often in the form of  dumbbells or barbells. People lift various kinds of weights for a variety of different reasons. These may include various types of competition; promoting health and fitness; developing physical  strength; or developing a muscular physique, possibly with the goal of engaging in competitive  bodybuilding.According to an article in The New York Times, lifting weights can prevent some  disabilities, increase metabolism, and lower body fat. When compared to machines, free weights improve not only strength but muscle function as well. Lifting weights can also improve self-confidence and make people feel better about themselves.
