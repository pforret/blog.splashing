# Sport: padel

Padel, sometimes called padel tennis, is a racket sport of Mexican origin, typically played in  doubles on an enclosed court slightly smaller than a doubles tennis court. Although padel shares the same scoring system as tennis, the rules, strokes, and technique are  different. The balls used are similar but with a little less pressure. The main differences are that the court has walls and the balls can be played off them in a similar  way as in the game of squash and that solid, stringless bats are used. The height of the ball being served must be at or below the waist level.
