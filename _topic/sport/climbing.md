# Sport: climbing

Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or other parts of the body to ascend a steep  topographical object that can range from the world's tallest mountains  to small boulders. Climbing is done for locomotion, sporting recreation, for competition, and is also done in trades  that rely on ascension, such as rescue and military operations. Climbing is done indoors and outdoors, on natural surfaces, and on artificial surfaces   The sport of climbing has evolved by climbers making first ascents of new types of climbing routes,  using new climbing techniques, at ever-increasing grades of difficulty, with ever-improving pieces  of climbing equipment.
