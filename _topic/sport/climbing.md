# Sport: climbing

Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of the body to ascend a 
steep topographical object.
It is done for locomotion, recreation and competition, and within trades that rely on ascension; 
such as emergency rescue and military operations.
It is done indoors and out, on natural and man-made structures.

Professional mountain guides or rock climbing guides, such as members of the IFMGA, have been known 
to be a historically significant element of developing the popularity of the sport in the natural 
environment, and remain so today.
