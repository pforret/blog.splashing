# Sport: climbing

Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of the body to ascend a  steep topographical object that can range from the world's tallest mountains, to small boulders.  Climbing is done for locomotion, sporting recreation, and for competition, and is also done in  trades that rely on ascension; such as emergency rescue and military operations.  Climbing is done indoors and outdoors and on natural  and artificial surfaces.
