# Sport: triathlon

A triathlon is an endurance multisport race consisting of swimming, cycling, and running over 
various distances.
Triathletes compete for fastest overall completion time, racing each segment sequentially with the 
time transitioning between the disciplines included.
The word is of Greek origin, from τρεῖς or treis  and ἆθλος or athlos .The sport has its roots in 
multi-event races held in France during the 1920s, with more specified rules and races forming 
during the late 1970s in Southern California as sports clubs and individuals developed the sport.
This history has meant that variations of the sport were created and still exist.
It also led to other three stage races using the name triathlon despite not being continuous or not 
consisting of swim, bike, and run elements.Triathletes train to achieve endurance, strength and 
speed.
