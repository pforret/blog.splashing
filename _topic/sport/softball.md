# Sport: softball

Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball  on a field that has base lengths 
of 60 feet, a pitcher's mound that ranges from 35 to 43   feet away from home plate, and a home run 
fence that is 220â€“300 feet away from home plate, depending on the type of softball being played.
Softball is played competitively at club levels, the college level, and the professional level.

There are two rules codes for softball generally: slow-pitch softball and fast pitch softball.
Slow-pitch softball is the most common type, while women's fast pitch softball is a Summer Olympic 
sport and is played professionally by women.
