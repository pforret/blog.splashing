# Sport: curling

Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area which is 
segmented into four concentric circles.
It is related to bowls, boules, and shuffleboard.
Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called 
rocks, across the ice curling sheet toward the house, a circular target marked on the ice.
Each team has eight stones, with each player throwing two.
The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game; points are scored for the stones resting 
closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end, which is completed when both 
teams have thrown all of their stones once.
