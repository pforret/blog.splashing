# Sport: basketball

Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one 
another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball  
through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches  in diameter mounted 10 feet  high to a backboard 
at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.
A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth 
three.
After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is 
given one, two or three one-point free throws.
The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the 
score tied, an additional period of play  is mandated.
