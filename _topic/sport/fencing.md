# Sport: fencing

Fencing is a group of three related combat sports.
The three disciplines in modern fencing are the  foil, the épée, and the sabre ; winning points are 
made through the weapon's contact with an opponent.
A fourth discipline, singlestick, appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped after that, and is 
not a part of modern fencing.
Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics.
Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship, the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th 
century, with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical 
fencing, and the French school later refining the Italian system.
