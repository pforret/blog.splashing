# Sport: hockey

Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports  which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel and, notably, playing  surface, they share broad characteristics of two teams playing against each other to propel a ball  or disk into a goal with a stick.  There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not.
