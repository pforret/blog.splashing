Pilates  is a type of mind-body exercise developed in the early 20th century by German physical  trainer Joseph Pilates, after whom it was named. Pilates called his method Contrology. It is practiced worldwide, especially in developed countries such as Australia, Canada, South  Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. Pilates uses a combination of around 50 repetitive exercises to spur muscle exertion. Each exercise flows from the five essentials: breath, cervical alignment, rib and scapular  stabilization, pelvic mobility, and utilization of the transversus abdominis.
