# Sport: golf

Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of 
holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.

Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping 
with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game.
The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though 
recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes.
Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing 
the actual hole or cup 4+1‚ÅÑ4 inches  in diameter.
