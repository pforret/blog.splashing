# Sport: canoe

A canoe is a lightweight narrow water vessel, typically pointed at both ends and open on top,  propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel and using  paddles. In British English, the term canoe can also refer to a kayak, while canoes are then called Canadian  or open canoes to distinguish them from kayaks. However, for official competition purposes, the American distinction between a kayak and a canoe is  almost always adopted.Canoes were developed by cultures all over the world, including some designed  for use with sails or outriggers. Until the mid-19th century, the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and  trade, and in some places is still used as such, sometimes with the addition of an outboard motor. Where the canoe played a key role in history, such as the Northern United States, Canada, and New  Zealand, it remains an important theme in popular culture.
