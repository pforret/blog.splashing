# Sport: parasailing

Parasailing, also known as parascending, paraskiing or parakiting, is a recreational kiting  activity where a person is towed behind a vehicle while attached to a specially designed canopy  wing that resembles a parachute, known as a parasail wing. The manned kite's moving anchor may be a car, truck, or boat. The harness attaches the occupant to the parasail, which is connected to the boat, or land vehicle,  by the tow rope. The vehicle then drives off, carrying the parascender  and person into the air. If the boat is powerful enough, two or three people can parasail behind it at the same time.
