# Sport: kayak

A kayak is a small, narrow human-powered watercraft typically propelled by means of a long,  double-bladed paddle. The word kayak originates from the Greenlandic word qajaq .  In British English, the kayak is considered to be a kind of canoe. While technically understandable, in the North American sense this is not the case.
