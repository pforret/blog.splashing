# Sport: kayak

A kayak is a small, narrow watercraft which is typically propelled by means of a double-bladed  paddle. The word kayak originates from the Greenlandic word qajaq .  The traditional kayak has a covered deck and one or more cockpits, each seating one paddler. The cockpit is sometimes covered by a spray deck that prevents the entry of water from waves or  spray, differentiating the craft from a canoe.
