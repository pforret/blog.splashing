# Sport: swimming

Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation,  sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve  hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks  of birth, as a survival response.Swimming is a popular recreational activity and competitive sport  that involves moving through water using various techniques. It offers numerous health benefits and is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.
