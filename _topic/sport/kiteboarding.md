Kiteboarding or kitesurfing is a sport that involves using wind power with a large power kite to  pull a rider across a water, land, or snow surface. It combines the aspects of paragliding, surfing, windsurfing, skateboarding, snowboarding, and  wakeboarding. Kiteboarding is among the less expensive and more convenient sailing sports.
