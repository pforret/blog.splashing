# Sport: rowing

Rowing is the act of propelling a boat using the motion of oars in the water by displacing water to 
propel the boat forward.
Rowing and paddling are similar.
However, rowing requires oars to have a mechanical connection with the boat, while paddles  are 
hand-held and have no mechanical connection.

In some strict terminologies, using oars for propulsion may be termed either pulling or rowing, 
with different definitions for each.
