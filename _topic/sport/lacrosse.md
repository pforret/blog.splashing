# Sport: lacrosse

Lacrosse is a contact team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. It is the oldest organized sport in North America, with its origins with the indigenous people of  North America as early as the 12th century. The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its  current collegiate and professional form.Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass,  catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has five versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field  lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse, lacrosse sixes and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse  and box lacrosse, are contact sports and all players wear  protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads.
