# Sport: bobsleigh

Bobsleigh or bobsled is a winter sport in which teams of 2 to 4 athletes make timed runs down  narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sleigh. International bobsleigh competitions are governed by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton  Federation .  The first bobsleds were built in the late 19th century in St. Moritz, Switzerland, by wealthy tourists from Victorian Britain who were staying at the Palace  Hotel owned by Caspar Badrutt.
