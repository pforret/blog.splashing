# Sport: surfing

Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer, uses a board to ride on the 
forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the 
shore.
Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing 
waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.

The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance.
There are several types of boards.
