# Sport: boxing

Boxing  is a combat sport and a martial art in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves  and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for  a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.  Although the term boxing is commonly attributed to Western boxing, in which only fists are  involved, it has developed in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the  World. In global terms, boxing today is also a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two  opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other  actions such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of these variants are the bare-knuckle boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei, savate, and  sanda.
