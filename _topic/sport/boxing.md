# Sport: boxing

Boxing  is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other 
protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a 
predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.
More generally, the term boxing can refer to any combat sport in which two opponents face each 
other in a fight using their fists, covered by gloves in most cases, and differentiated according 
to their rules, such as Western boxing, French boxing, Chinese boxing, Thai boxing, kickboxing, and 
the ancient pygmachia.While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human 
history, the earliest evidence of a form of boxing can be seen in Sumerian carvings from the 3rd 
and 2nd millennia BC.
The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as 
an Olympic game in 688 BC.
Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner 
of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry 
Rules.
