# Sport: sailing

Sailing employs the wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft on the surface of  the water, on ice  or on land  over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of  navigation.  From prehistory until the second half of the 19th century, sailing craft were the primary means of  maritime trade and transportation; exploration across the seas and oceans was reliant on sail for  anything other than the shortest distances. Naval power in this period used sail to varying degrees depending on the current technology,  culminating in the gun-armed sailing warships of the Age of Sail. Sail was slowly replaced by steam as the method of propulsion for ships over the latter part of the  19th century – seeing a gradual improvement in the technology of steam through a number of stepwise  developments.
