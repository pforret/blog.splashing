# Sport: cricket

Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre  of which is a 22-yard  pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three  stumps. Two players from the batting team  stand in front of either wicket, with one player from the  fielding team  bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the  batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is  bowled illegally.
