# Sport: trampoline

A trampoline is a device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched between a steel  frame often using many coiled springs. People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes.  The fabric that users bounce on  is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs  that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy.
