# Sport: trampoline

A trampoline is a device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched between a steel  frame using many coiled springs. Not all trampolines have springs, as the Springfree Trampoline uses glass-reinforced plastic rods. People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes.  The fabric that users bounce on  is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs  that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy.
