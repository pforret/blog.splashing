# Sport: skateboarding

Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding and 
performing tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an 
entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation.
Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years.
A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual 
revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world.
In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in 
Tokyo, for both male and female teams.Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed 
specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and very recently, 
scooters.
However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, although illegal, 
has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and parks.
