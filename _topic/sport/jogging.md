# Sport: jogging

Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace.
The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster 
running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time.
Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance training.
