# Sport: biathlon

The biathlon is a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting.
It is treated as a race, with contestants skiing through a cross-country trail whose distance is 
divided into shooting rounds.
The shooting rounds are not timed per se, but depending on the competition, missed shots result in 
extra distance or time being added to the contestant's total.
