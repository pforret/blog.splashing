# Sport: baseball

Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, of nine players each, that take 
turns batting and fielding.
The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a 
player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat.
The objective of the offensive team  is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its 
players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are 
called runs.
The objective of the defensive team  is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent 
runners' advance around the bases.
A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate .
