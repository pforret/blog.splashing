# Sport: baseball

Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns  batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player  on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called  the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team  is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other  team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around  four bases to score what are called runs. The objective of the defensive team  is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent  runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate .
