# Sport: judo

Judo, lit.
gentle way is a system of unarmed combat, modern Japanese martial art and Olympic sport .
Judo was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano  as an eclectic martial art, distinguishing itself from its 
predecessors  due to an emphasis on randori  instead of kata  alongside its removal of striking and 
weapon training elements.
Judo rose to prominence for its dominance over established jujutsu schools in tournaments hosted by 
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, resulting in its adoption as the department's primary 
martial art.
As jujutsu was a Japanese term referring to this sub-type of martial arts in general, Judo was 
colloquially known as Kano Jujutsu or Kano Ryu  to differentiate it from other jujutsu schools; 
this naming convention decreased in prominence due to the adoption of the formal name of Judo.
