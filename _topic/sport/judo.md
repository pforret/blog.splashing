# Sport: judo

Judo  is an unarmed modern Japanese martial art, Olympic sport, and the most prominent form of  jacket wrestling competed internationally. Judo was created in 1882 by Kanō Jigorō  as an eclectic martial art, distinguishing itself from its  predecessors  due to an emphasis on randori  instead of kata  alongside its removal of striking and  weapon training elements. Judo rose to prominence for its dominance over established jujutsu schools in tournaments hosted by  the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, resulting in its adoption as the department's primary  martial art. A judo practitioner is called a judoka, and the judo uniform is called judogi .
