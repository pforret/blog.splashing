# Sport: figure skating

Figure skating is a sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games, with its introduction occurring  at the 1908 Olympics in London. The Olympic disciplines are men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance; the four  individual disciplines are also combined into a team event, which was first included in the Winter  Olympics in 2014. The non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs, which,  depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps,  death spirals, and other elements or moves.
