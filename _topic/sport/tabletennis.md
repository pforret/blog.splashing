# Sport: table tennis

Table tennis  is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface being  atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two, players take alternating turns returning a light, hollow  ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small rackets until they fail  to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis  on spin relative to other ball sports, which can heavily affect the ball's trajectory.  Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and  relative accessibility of equipment, table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive  sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels and ages.
