A Chromebook  is a laptop or tablet running the Linux-based Chrome OS as its operating system.
Initially designed to heavily rely on web applications for tasks using the Google Chrome browser, 
Chromebooks have since expanded to be able to run Android and full-fledged Linux apps since 2017 
and 2018, respectively.
All supported apps can be installed and launched alongside each other.Chromebooks can work offline; 
applications like Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Drive synchronize data when 
reconnecting to the Internet.
Google Play video content is available offline using the Google Play Movies {wikipedia} TV extension with the 
Chrome browser.The first Chromebooks shipped on June 15, 2011.
Other form factors include Chromebox desktops, Chromebase, which places the computer in an 
all-in-one unit, an HDMI stick PC called a Chromebit, and Chromebook tablets.
