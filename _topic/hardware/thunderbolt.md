# thunderbolt

A thunderbolt or lightning bolt is a symbolic representation of lightning when accompanied by a 
loud thunderclap.
In Indo-European mythology, the thunderbolt was identified with the 'Sky Father'; this association 
is also found in later Hellenic representations of Zeus and Vedic descriptions of the vajra wielded 
by the god Indra.
It may have been a symbol of cosmic order, as expressed in the fragment from Heraclitus describing 
the Thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.In its original usage the word may also have 
been a description of the consequences of a close approach between two planetary cosmic bodies, as 
Plato suggested in Timaeus, or, according to Victor Clube, meteors, though this is not currently 
the case.
As a divine manifestation the thunderbolt has been a powerful symbol throughout history, and has 
appeared in many mythologies.
Drawing from this powerful association, the thunderbolt is often found in military symbolism and 
semiotic representations of electricity.
