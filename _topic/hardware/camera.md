# camera

A camera is an optical instrument that captures a visual image.
At a basic level, cameras consist of sealed boxes, with a small hole  that allows light through to 
capture an image on a light-sensitive surface .
Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface.
Lenses focus the light entering the camera.
The aperture can be narrowed or widened.
