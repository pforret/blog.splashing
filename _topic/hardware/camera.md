A camera is an optical instrument that captures images. Most cameras can capture 2D images, while some more advanced models can capture 3D images. At a basic level, most cameras consist of a sealed box, with a small hole  that allows light to  pass through and capture an image on a light-sensitive surface . Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the light-sensitive surface,  including lenses that focus the light and a shutter that determines the amount of time the  photosensitive surface is exposed to the light.
