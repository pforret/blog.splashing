As a pivotal technology in the fields of photography and videography, cameras have played a  significant role in the progression of visual arts, media, entertainment, surveillance, and  scientific research. The invention of the camera dates back to the 19th century and has since evolved with advancements  in technology, leading to a vast array of types and models in the 21st century.
