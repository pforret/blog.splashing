# laptop

A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer  with a 
screen and alphanumeric keyboard.
Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted on the inside of the upper 
lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard 
are often marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode.
Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.
Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed practical to be placed on a person's lap when being used.
Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, 
web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.
