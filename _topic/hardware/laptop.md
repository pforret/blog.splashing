# laptop

A laptop computer or notebook computer, also laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable  personal computer . Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen  on the inside of the upper  lid, and an alphanumeric keyboard  on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a  detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode. The internal hardwares are fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, and it's not  uncommon for laptops to have a pointing device such as a trackpad or trackpoint. Many modern laptops also have a built-in webcam and even a touch screen display.
