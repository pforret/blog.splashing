# laptop

A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable  personal computer . Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen  on the inside of the upper  lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device  on the inside of the lower lid, although  2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode. Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the  keyboard, although many laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen and some modern  ones even feature a touch-screen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run  on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.
