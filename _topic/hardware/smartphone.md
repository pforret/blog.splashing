# smartphone

A smartphone is a portable device that combines mobile telephone and computing functions into one 
unit.
They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive 
mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet, and multimedia functionality, 
alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.
Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor  integrated circuit  chips, 
include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party software, and support 
wireless communications protocols .

Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to bridge the 
functionality of standalone personal digital assistant  devices with support for cellular 
telephony, but were limited by their bulky form, short battery life, slow analog cellular networks, 
and the immaturity of wireless data services.
