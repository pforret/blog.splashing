A smartphone  is a mobile device that combines the functionality of a traditional mobile phone with  advanced computing capabilities. It typically has a touchscreen interface, allowing users to access a wide range of applications and  services, such as web browsing, email, and social media, as well as multimedia playback and  streaming. Smartphones also have built-in cameras, GPS navigation, and support for various communication  methods, including voice calls, text messaging, and internet-based messaging apps.  Smartphones are distinguished from older-design feature phones by their more advanced hardware  capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, access to the internet, business applications,  mobile payments, and multimedia functionality, including music, video, gaming, radio, and  television.
