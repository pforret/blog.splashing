# Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi ( is a series of small single-board computers  developed in the United Kingdom by the 
Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom.
The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science 
in schools and in developing countries.
The original model became more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses 
such as robotics.
It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, because of its low cost, 
modularity, and open design.
It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of HDMI and USB 
devices.
