# Nest

A nest is a structure built for certain animals to hold eggs or young.
 Although nests are most closely associated with birds, members of all classes of vertebrates and 
some invertebrates construct nests.
 They may be composed of organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves, or may be a simple 
depression in the ground, or a hole in a rock, tree, or building.
Human-made materials, such as string, plastic, cloth, or paper, may also be used.
Nests can be found in all types of habitat.
