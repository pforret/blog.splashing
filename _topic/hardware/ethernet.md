# ethernet

Ethernet  is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in local area  networks, metropolitan area networks  and wide area networks .  It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has since been refined to support higher bit rates, a greater number of nodes, and longer  link distances, but retains much backward compatibility. Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as Token Ring, FDDI  and ARCNET.
