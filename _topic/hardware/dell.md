# Dell

Dell is an American company that develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers and related 
products and services, and is owned by its parent company of Dell Technologies.
Founded in 1984 by Michael Dell, the company is one of the largest technology corporations in the 
world, employing more than 165,000 people around the world.Dell sells personal computers, servers, 
data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, 
and electronics built by other manufacturers.
The company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, 
particularly its direct-sales model and its build-to-order or configure to order approach to 
manufacturingâ€”delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.
Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of 
Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services.
The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim 
of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions for 
enterprise customers.Dell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list until 2014.
