A lens is a transmissive optical device which focuses or disperses a light beam by means of 
refraction.
A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while a compound lens consists of 
several simple lenses, usually arranged along a common axis.
Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or molded to a 
desired shape.
A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing.
Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also 
called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.
