It was one of the biggest manufacturers of personal computers, consumer electronics, home  appliances, and medical equipment. As a semiconductor company and the inventor of flash memory, Toshiba had been one of the top 10 in  the chip industry until its flash memory unit was spun off as Toshiba Memory, later Kioxia, in the  late 2010s.The Toshiba name is derived from its former name, Tokyo Shibaura Denki K.K.  which in turn was a 1939 merger between Shibaura Seisaku-sho  and Tokyo Denki .
